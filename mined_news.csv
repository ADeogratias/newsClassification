0,"('multiple', None, None, ['\nWashington — Former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb on Sunday said that a rise in coronavirus infections among young people is driving new outbreaks in some states, but he does not believe there will be a ""true"" fourth wave of the pandemic.\n""What we\'re seeing is pockets of infection around the country, particularly in younger people who haven\'t been vaccinated and also in school-aged children,"" Gottlieb said in an interview on ""Face the Nation,"" noting the rise in cases among school-aged kids in Michigan, Minnesota and Massachusetts.\xa0\n""You\'re seeing outbreaks in schools and infections in social cohorts that haven\'t been exposed to the virus before, maybe were doing a better job sheltering, now they\'re out and about getting exposed to the virus and they\'re getting infected,"" he continued. ""The infection is changing its contours in terms of who\'s being stricken by it right now.""\nTranscript: Dr. Scott Gottlieb on ""Face the Nation""With coronavirus cases rising in 27 states and the District of Columbia, public health officials are urging Americans to remain vigilant in following mitigation measures. But as the rate of vaccinations continues to accelerate — 4 million doses were administered Friday alone — and roughly 130 million Americans having already contracted COVID-19, Gottlieb said the level of immunity in the U.S. should head off a fourth wave of the pandemic.\nAs of Saturday, more than 104 million Americans have received at least one dose of their coronavirus vaccine, while 59.8 million Americans are fully vaccinated, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n""You have somewhere around 200 million Americans that have some level of immunity in them already,"" he said. ""I think there\'s enough immunity in the population that you\'re not going to see a true fourth wave of infection.""\nWhile more young people are becoming infected with COVID-19, Gottlieb said he does not believe schools should close their doors to in-person learning, but instead should be made safer to combat the spread of the virus.\n""I think we need to stick to strict mitigation in the schools, the schools that use masks, schools that can implement some kind of distancing, as one epidemiologist referred to it this week, go the \'full Harry Potter\' and try to keep students within defined social cohorts so that they\'re not intermingling in large groups,"" he said. ""If you\'re taking those measures in schools, I think the schools can be made more safe, and I think the benefits of being in school outweigh the risks. But we need to be cognizant of the fact that schools are a risk factor, children are vulnerable to the infection and that schools can become focal points for community spread if we\'re not careful.""\nCoronavirus vaccines from Moderna and Johnson & Johnson are authorized for adults ages 18 and older, while Pfizer\'s vaccine is approved for people as young as 16. But Pfizer and Moderna have been testing their vaccines in children 12 and older and are beginning clinical trials of their shots in young children.\xa0\nPfizer announced last week in a study of 2,260 U.S. volunteers between 12 and 15 years old, its vaccine was found to be safe and demonstrated 100% efficacy. Gottlieb is a member of Pfizer\'s board of directors.\nVaccinating children will be crucial for getting schools reopened and helping the U.S. reach herd immunity, and Dr. Anthony Fauci, chief medical adviser to President Biden, said Friday he believes\xa0there could be enough information to be able to safely vaccinate children of any age by the end of the year.\nGottlieb said he believes the FDA could authorize Pfizer\'s vaccine for emergency use for children between the ages of 12 and 15 in time to have it available before the start of the school year, but warned it could be longer before children younger than 12 are approved to get their shots.\n""I do think we\'re going to be in a position to vaccinate 12 and above before the fall,"" he said. ""I think younger than that could take more time because you\'re going to want to test a lot of different doses to try to find the lowest possible dose that still is providing a robust immune response to kids.""\nEven though public health officials are warning Americans not to buck guidelines with the rise in coronavirus infections, families are continuing to travel for the spring break holiday, and the Transportation Security Administration has reported a spike in airport screenings.\nGottlieb encouraged health officials to issue guidance the public will largely follow but said it\'s important for them to urge caution.\xa0\n""You don\'t want to be so out of step with the aspirations and where the public is and what the public is going to ultimately engage in that the guidance just gets ignored. You have to issue the guidance in the context of what the public\'s willing to do,"" he said.\xa0\nStill, Gottlieb stressed that the U.S. remains in a ""high-prevalence environment"" with new coronavirus variants circulating.\n""We don\'t want to be in a position where we extend the epidemic because we weren\'t prudent about the steps that we were taking right now,"" he said. ""That said, people are sensing that there\'s less risk overall. As people get vaccinated, they feel themselves that they\'re at less risk and they are, based on the vaccination. And so they\'re willing to start engaging in the things that they put off for a full year. So we need to recognize that and I think issue the guidance in a way that people can conform to it against, you know, their aspirations, which is that they want to see family again. They want to start socializing. They want to start traveling a little bit.""\n'])",politics,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gottlieb-covid-infections-hot-spots-face-the-nation/
1,"('multiple', None, None, ['\nVaccine hesitancy in the evangelical communit...It\'s a case that will need to be made clearly if evangelicals — perhaps the most under-discussed group with high levels of vaccine hesitancy — can be persuaded.\xa0\n""Jesus does tell the story of a man that was beaten and robbed and left for dead on the side of a road, and religious leaders walked past him and did not have compassion, they didn\'t get involved. But a Samaritan had compassion,"" Graham told CBS News in an interview. ""And he immediately bandaged — he put oil and wine on his wounds and took him to an inn, and paid to have him cared for. Now the oil and wine were the medicines of that day ... The vaccine is, to me, I believe, is saving life, and that\'s what Jesus Christ would want us to do, to help save life. It\'s just a tool to help save life.""\nRev. Franklin Graham waves to attendees during his ""Decision America"" California tour at the Stanislaus County Fairgrounds on May 29, 2018 in Turlock, California.Graham, the son of the late evangelist Billy Graham and grandson of a medical missionary in China, noted that the church has a long tradition of using medicine to help others. Last week, he told his 9 million Facebook followers that his international relief charity, Samaritan\'s Purse, had seen human suffering from COVID-19 ""first-hand,"" and encouraged people to ""talk to their doctor, and pray about it to determine which vaccine, if any, is right for them.""\xa0 \xa0\nWhile thousands of users liked and ""hearted"" the post, most commenters reacted with indignation or dismay.\xa0\n""As far as we know, Fauci helped develop COVID-19!!"" one wrote, referring to the director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Anthony Fauci, who is also President Joe Biden\'s chief medical advisor.\xa0\n""The government and the media created insane fear over this flu — flu of certain death motivated people to comply like sheep,"" wrote another.\xa0\n""It has aborted cells in it… I am against abortion,"" responded another woman.\xa0\nThough anecdotal, the responses underlined a trend. Evangelicals, especially white evangelicals, are the religious group most likely to say they do not want the vaccine.\xa0\nA Pew Research Center survey conducted in February found that white evangelicals were the least likely religious group to say they will ""definitely or probably"" get the COVID-19 vaccine (54%), or already had, and the most likely to say they ""definitely"" or ""probably"" would not get the vaccine (45%). That\'s out of all Protestants, White and Black, White and Hispanic Catholics, atheists, agnostics and ""nothing in particulars.""\xa0\nUnderstanding why that is, and encouraging those who might be persuadable, could save lives as the country works to reach herd immunity, which Fauci estimates will requires 70% to 90% of the population to be vaccinated. So far, roughly 17% of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated.\xa0\nCurtis Chang, a former senior pastor who\'s now a Duke Divinity School consulting professor and runs his own consulting firm working with public health entities and nonprofits, has created a project called Christians and the Vaccine. His website offers scientific information on the vaccine from a biblical perspective, in bite-sized, shareable videos to reach evangelicals who aren\'t being persuaded by public health officials.\xa0\n""The message I\'ve been trying to get to secular public health officials is very simple — it\'s that the pathway to ending the pandemic runs through the evangelical church. I mean, it\'s just undeniable statistically,"" Chang said in a phone interview with CBS News. ""And public health has got to start investing resources and energy to equip evangelicals to be the ones out there trying to convince their fellow brothers and sisters.""\nGraham hoped his post might persuade Christians who are on the fence about getting a shot, which he considers a ""no brainer."" In partnership with local health officials, Samaritan\'s Purse runs a vaccine clinic in Boone, North Carolina, which has already vaccinated more than 5,000 people.\nThe internet is full of articles, theories, data, and opinions concerning the COVID-19 vaccines—both positive and...\n""Samaritan\'s Purse has been working in COVID areas,"" Graham told CBS News. ""Last year, we were in Cremona in Italy. We were working in New York City. And then we went on to the Bahamas and opened up another one here in North Carolina, then Los Angeles County. We have seen what COVID can do. I\'ve had some of my own staff, one of them was on a ventilator for three months. And I\'m just, from what I have seen and experienced myself, I don\'t want COVID and I don\'t want anybody else to get it.""\nThe reasons for vaccine hesitancy among evangelicals are manifold. Some object to the distant connection to aborted fetal tissue, particularly with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Some distrust the federal government and big pharma. Still others point to the statistical likelihood that a person will recover from COVID, and Jesus as the great healer. Some fear it is the ""mark of the beast,"" a reference to a symbol in the Book of Revelations. The lack of long-term clinical trials and other uknowns about long-term effects are also a concern for many.\nOne Christian who doesn\'t want to get the vaccine on religious grounds is Othneil Hinckson, an evangelical pastor in Texas whose family generally relies on prayer rather than medicine to get over illness. He believes COVID-19 is real and that it\'s a serious disease. But for him, COVID-19 is no different than other illnesses, and believers can be healed through the power of prayer. Hinckson may be among a small minority of evangelical communities that generally avoid medical intervention in favor of divine healing, but his beliefs are firm.\xa0\n""Any vaccine, as far as I stand, I don\'t need it, because I have something better,"" he told CBS News. ""When man heals you, there\'s always the possibility of complications… It\'s hard to explain, but we\'re doing our best to trust God with everything we are.""\xa0\nHe said his family has so far avoided the illness, and he isn\'t aware of anyone in his congregation who has fallen ill with COVID-19.\xa0\nGraham said he understands concerns about a new vaccine, and said there will always be skeptics on any issue, not just among Christians.\xa0\n""I think people are scared of new things,"" Graham said. ""Especially when it comes to somewhere where you take a jab in your arm and they put a serum or vaccine into your arm. I think there are always people who will be afraid. So I don\'t fault them, and I certainly understand if they have concerns. And I think my statement was just for people that may be on the fence a little bit. I just want them to understand where I was coming from and why I took it. But I\'m certainly not telling others that they have to take it. It\'s just, I think it\'s a good health decision. Again, I have seen COVID and what it can do to a person, and you don\'t want it. It\'s just as simple as that.""\nChang started his project in late December, after a conversation with the CEO of a leading health agency in the Bay Area who either had never heard of, or didn\'t realize the significance of concerns specific to evangelicals surrounding the vaccine. He realized that public health professionals lacked the language to communicate with the evangelical community, and the evangelical community, in turn, at times didn\'t trust public health officials.\xa0\n""Secular public health [officials] are going to pump out all sorts of scientific and medical information, which is necessary,"" Chang said. ""That\'s an important piece of the puzzle — it\'s not like it doesn\'t matter. But there\'s this whole other set of spiritual, religious, moral, cultural concerns that they just don\'t have the language or understanding to speak to. So they\'re going to be, basically, it\'s like putting out steak to a vegetarian.""\nSo Chang, who was already concerned that evangelicals might not accept the vaccine given the politicization of the mask issue and backlash over church restrictions, launched\xa0ChristiansAndTheVaccine.com.\xa0\n""I have produced these videos, with each video trying to address one of the questions that I think especially secular public health was going to have a difficulty addressing,"" Chang said. ""The reason why I put it in short video formats was, if you go on in terms of how misinformation is spreading on this issue, it\'s happening by short videos being passed along by person to person within their own networks. So that\'s how the misinformation is spreading and it\'s spreading virally.""\nChang hopes his project will serve as a particularly useful resource for pastors, who might not want to preach on the hot-button subject or get pulled into lengthy email discussions with members, but might be able to share a short, informational video. Evangelical leaders are more likely than their congregants to say they\'ll get the vaccine. According to a January Evangelical Leaders Survey, a whopping 95% of evangelical leaders who responded said they would get the vaccine, and 89% said they would encourage others to do the same.\xa0\n""The reason why I\'m creating these videos is so that pastors didn\'t have to go up on Sunday morning and preach about it,"" Chang said. ""They could just, when they get the question, they can just say, \'here, watch this video.\'""\nPublic health professionals are slowly beginning to pick up on the importance of addressing vaccine hesitancy among evangelicals, Chang said.\xa0\nOn Thursday, the Ad Council announced a new partnership with the COVID Collaborative and Chang\'s project, ChristiansAndTheVaccine.com, and other evangelical groups to try to reach evangelicals with information from people they trust about COVID-19 vaccines. The Biden administration has begun to realize the importance of reaching evangelicals, too, and has started partnering with faith leaders to help them reach their congregants.\xa0\n""This is a chance for us to really be good citizens of the world,"" Chang said. ""As evangelicals, if we allow the virus to replicate unchecked within our own community — even if we think, \'Okay, we\'re willing to tolerate that risk,\' we\'re allowing the virus to continue to replicate, and that is precisely the recipe for developing variants in this virus that can eventually get around the vaccine and ruin it for everyone else.""\n© 2021 CBS Interactive Inc.

2,"('multiple', None, None, ['\nWhite House economic adviser says infrastruct...More than two dozen large U.S. companies have made a collective $77 billion in domestic profits in the past three years without any expectation of having to immediately pay federal taxes on their bounty. Indeed, they haven\'t expensed a single dollar for current federal taxes since Donald Trump pushed through a massive tax cut for corporations in the first year of his presidency, according to a new study.\xa0\nMany of those same companies had together paid billions of dollars in annual taxes prior to Trump\'s presidency.\xa0\nFor instance, Salesforce.com has made $4.2 billion in the past three years before taxes. But since 2018, the software company hasn\'t put any money aside to pay federal taxes, according to its filings with securities regulators. In fact, Salesforce booked $4 million in tax credits since 2018. In the three years prior to Trump\'s tax cut, Salesforce earned far less but expensed far more for taxes — $35 million on $500 million in profits.\nA spokesperson for Salesforce did not respond to a question from CBS MoneyWatch regarding how much the company has paid in taxes.\nThe study, from the liberal-leaning Institute for Taxation and Economic Policy, comes as the national debate heats up on whether corporations pay their fair share in taxes. This week, President Joe Biden said he hopes to significantly raise taxes on corporations to help pay for a $2 trillion plan to upgrade the nation\'s infrastructure, which could cost the federal government trillions of dollars.\nMr. Biden said that his infrastructure proposalBiden details $2 trillion infrastructure plan...Mr. Biden outlined a planHad Mr. Biden\'s plan been in effect, the 26 profitable companies highlighted in the ITEP study together would have paid at least $11.6 billion in federal taxes since 2018, instead of the nearly $5 billion in tax credits they collected over that time.\n""There\'s already this suspicion that big corporations aren\'t paying their fair share,"" said Matthew Gardner, a senior fellow at ITEP and one of the authors of the study. "" A finding like this is going to support that view.""\nAlthough it\'s clear companies are paying significantly less than what they did before the Trump tax cuts, just how much less a given business is contributing in taxes is less certain. The reason: Companies, like individuals, are allowed to keep their tax filings and payments private.\xa0\nYet public companies that report their profits to investors also must offer in their financial filings a rough estimate of how much they might have to pay in taxes over the next 12 months and any tax expenses they might face in the future. They\'re also required to detail to whom those taxes are likely to be paid, such as the federal government, a state, or foreign governments.\nThe ITEP study zeroed in on the current amount of federal income tax that companies listed in the S&P 500 stock index expensed in the past three years. Accounting experts have traditionally said that figure offers a fairly good estimate of what companies may have paid in federal taxes. Less helpfully, provisions in the 2017 tax cut law have made that figure less reliable.\nFor instance, ITEP identified FedEx as one company that hasn\'t paid federal taxes in the past three years. The\xa0delivery giant has previously disputed that claim, saying it pays annual federal income taxes while declining to disclose how much. FedEx\'s financial statements show that its cash accounts — another way to measure corporate earnings — dropped by $400 million due to tax payments during the past three years.\nStill, what many U.S. companies pay in taxes might provoke envy among individual taxpayers. A recent financial filing indicated that Zoom, whose revenue and profits have surged during the coronavirus pandemic, had expensed no federal taxes for 2020\xa0despite the videoconferencing company\'s record earnings.\nAccording to a CBS MoneyWatch analysis of data from FactSet, the median effective corporate tax rate of companies in the S&P 500 last year was just 18% — down from 23% in 2017. Notably, that\'s for all taxes paid. Look at just federal income taxes and those companies\' effective rates are likely to be much lower.\nDuke Energy, for instance, had U.S. pretax profits of nearly $8 billion over the past three years. Not only did Duke pay zero federal taxes during that time, it also booked a federal income tax credit of just over $1.2 billion, according to ITEP.\xa0\nResponding to the study, Duke Energy told the New York Times that investments in renewable energy have allowed it to delay, but not eliminate, its federal tax obligations. The company\'s most recent annual financial filing recorded a $9 billion liability for future federal tax payments.\nOther major companies that ITEP researchers said haven\'t paid federal taxes in recent years despite booking big profits include TV and internet provider Dish Network and athletic gear company Nike.\nOn Friday, in response to the study, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders tweeted that a $120 pair of Nike Air Force 1 shoes would cost you more than what the company paid in taxes over the past three years.\nIf you paid $120 for a pair of Nike Air Force 1 shoes, you paid more to Nike than it paid in federal income taxes over the past 3 years, while it made $4.1 billion in profits and Nike\'s founder, Phil Knight, became over $23 billion richer. Yes. We must #TaxTheRich.\nA spokesperson for Nike did not respond to a request for comment.\nITEP also identified 55 companies that made money in the past, but that didn\'t appear to have paid any money in federal taxes on those profits.

But it also used 11,330 lines of code and an organization that\'s part of Oracle\'s Java platform.\nGoogle had argued that what it did is long-settled, common practice in the industry, a practice that has been good for technical progress. And it said there is no copyright protection for the purely functional, noncreative computer code it used, something that couldn\'t be written another way. But Oracle said Google ""committed an egregious act of plagiarism,"" and it sued.\nThe justices sided with Google 6-2 in a 62-page opinion on Monday.

8,"('multiple', None, None, ['\nVA secretary on benefits of American Rescue P...The IRS on Friday said it is continuing to review payment data it received from the VA, but doesn\'t yet have a specific payment date available for those recipients. It said it believes that VA beneficiaries who don\'t regularly file tax returns could receive their payments by mid-April, however. The tax agency did not disclose how many veterans may be waiting for their money.\nThe latest twist comes amid delays for some government benefit recipients, including 30 million people who receive benefits through Social Security and other agencies but who don\'t normally file tax returns. Because the IRS has relied on tax returns to find bank information or addresses for recipients, as well as to check their income eligibility, it\'s faced a bigger hurdle in getting payments to people who don\'t file tax returns.\xa0\nIn the latest round of $1,400 stimulus checks, the IRS first distributed the payments to people for whom it had payment data on file, such as people who had filed either their 2019 or 2020 tax returns. But it didn\'t receive payment data from the Social Security Administration until late March for millions of beneficiaries who hadn\'t filed tax returns nor used the ""non-filers"" tool that the IRS had offered last year.\xa0\nBut the IRS isn\'t offering the ""non-filers"" tool this year, which means that people who don\'t file taxes don\'t have a way of providing their bank account information or their mailing address to the IRS — short of filing a tax return.\n""Currently, the IRS estimates that [stimulus payments] for VA beneficiaries who do not regularly file tax returns could be disbursed by mid-April,"" the IRS said on Friday. ""VA beneficiary payment information will be available in the Get My Payment tool at a future date.""\nThat may leave some veterans feeling frustrated, including the inability to check when their payments might arrive. The IRS didn\'t immediately return a request for comment.\nMeanwhile, Social Security recipients who are still waiting for their checks will see the payments arrive via direct deposit on April 7, according to the IRS. Some checks will be mailed, either via paper checks or pre-paid debit cards, which could take longer to arrive, however.\xa0\nSome Social Security recipients have already received their payments, the IRS said. Those include beneficiaries who used the non-Filers tool last year or have already filed their 2019 or 2020 tax returns.\nSome low-income people, such as single people over 65 who earn less than $14,050, aren\'t required to file taxes, which has made it more difficult for the IRS to determine where to send checks for those recipients. The IRS has generally relied on tax returns to determine eligibility as well as direct-deposit bank information.\nEven so, the IRS said some people who receive federal benefits and normally don\'t file a tax return may need to file one this year if they want to ensure the correct payment. That\'s particularly true for people with dependents, since the IRS may need a tax return to check for eligible dependents within a household.\xa0\n""Eligible individuals in this group should file a 2020 tax return to be considered for an additional payment for their qualified dependent as quickly as possible,"" the IRS said on Friday.\n© 2021 CBS Interactive Inc.

They\'re also required to detail to whom those taxes are likely to be paid, such as the federal government, a state, or foreign governments.\nThe ITEP study zeroed in on the current amount of federal income tax that companies listed in the S&P 500 stock index expensed in the past three years. Accounting experts have traditionally said that figure offers a fairly good estimate of what companies may have paid in federal taxes. Less helpfully, provisions in the 2017 tax cut law have made that figure less reliable.\nFor instance, ITEP identified FedEx as one company that hasn\'t paid federal taxes in the past three years. The\xa0delivery giant has previously disputed that claim, saying it pays annual federal income taxes while declining to disclose how much. FedEx\'s financial statements show that its cash accounts — another way to measure corporate earnings — dropped by $400 million due to tax payments during the past three years.\nStill, what many U.S. companies pay in taxes might provoke envy among individual taxpayers. A recent financial filing indicated that Zoom, whose revenue and profits have surged during the coronavirus pandemic, had expensed no federal taxes for 2020\xa0despite the videoconferencing company\'s record earnings.\nAccording to a CBS MoneyWatch analysis of data from FactSet, the median effective corporate tax rate of companies in the S&P 500 last year was just 18% — down from 23% in 2017. Notably, that\'s for all taxes paid. Look at just federal income taxes and those companies\' effective rates are likely to be much lower.\nDuke Energy, for instance, had U.S. pretax profits of nearly $8 billion over the past three years. Not only did Duke pay zero federal taxes during that time, it also booked a federal income tax credit of just over $1.2 billion, according to ITEP.\xa0\nResponding to the study, Duke Energy told the New York Times that investments in renewable energy have allowed it to delay, but not eliminate, its federal tax obligations. The company\'s most recent annual financial filing recorded a $9 billion liability for future federal tax payments.\nOther major companies that ITEP researchers said haven\'t paid federal taxes in recent years despite booking big profits include TV and internet provider Dish Network and athletic gear company Nike.\nOn Friday, in response to the study, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders tweeted that a $120 pair of Nike Air Force 1 shoes would cost you more than what the company paid in taxes over the past three years.\nIf you paid $120 for a pair of Nike Air Force 1 shoes, you paid more to Nike than it paid in federal income taxes over the past 3 years, while it made $4.1 billion in profits and Nike\'s founder, Phil Knight, became over $23 billion richer. Yes. We must #TaxTheRich.\nA spokesperson for Nike did not respond to a request for comment.\nITEP also identified 55 companies that made money in the past, but that didn\'t appear to have paid any money in federal taxes on those profits. For instance, the study said cable company Charter Communications made $3.6 billion during the pandemic, but booked a tax credit last year of $7 million.\nA spokesperson from Charter said the company paid state and local taxes last year. The company said prior loses and write-offs for investments had decreased its federal tax bill. The spokesman added that Charter, which analysts forecast will make $4 billion this year, expects to be a ""meaningful federal cash taxpayer"" in 2022.\n© 2021 CBS Interactive Inc.

Look at just federal income taxes and those companies\' effective rates are likely to be much lower.\nDuke Energy, for instance, had U.S. pretax profits of nearly $8 billion over the past three years. Not only did Duke pay zero federal taxes during that time, it also booked a federal income tax credit of just over $1.2 billion, according to ITEP.\xa0\nResponding to the study, Duke Energy told the New York Times that investments in renewable energy have allowed it to delay, but not eliminate, its federal tax obligations. The company\'s most recent annual financial filing recorded a $9 billion liability for future federal tax payments.\nOther major companies that ITEP researchers said haven\'t paid federal taxes in recent years despite booking big profits include TV and internet provider Dish Network and athletic gear company Nike.\nOn Friday, in response to the study, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders tweeted that a $120 pair of Nike Air Force 1 shoes would cost you more than what the company paid in taxes over the past three years.\nIf you paid $120 for a pair of Nike Air Force 1 shoes, you paid more to Nike than it paid in federal income taxes over the past 3 years, while it made $4.1 billion in profits and Nike\'s founder, Phil Knight, became over $23 billion richer. Yes. We must #TaxTheRich.\nA spokesperson for Nike did not respond to a request for comment.\nITEP also identified 55 companies that made money in the past, but that didn\'t appear to have paid any money in federal taxes on those profits. For instance, the study said cable company Charter Communications made $3.6 billion during the pandemic, but booked a tax credit last year of $7 million.\nA spokesperson from Charter said the company paid state and local taxes last year. The company said prior loses and write-offs for investments had decreased its federal tax bill. The spokesman added that Charter, which analysts forecast will make $4 billion this year, expects to be a ""meaningful federal cash taxpayer"" in 2022.\n'])",business,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tax-increase-corporate-taxes-trump-biden/

11,"('multiple', None, None, ['\nThe United States is working with G20 nations on a global minimum tax for companies, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Monday. It\'s part of President Biden\'s corporate tax plan that also includes raising the corporate tax rate in the United States and setting minimum taxes on U.S. companies\' foreign earnings.\xa0\nYellen said reaching an agreement would move the world away from what she called a 30-year race to the bottom.\n""Together we can use a global minimum tax to make sure the global economy thrives based on a more level playing field in the taxation of multinational corporations, and spurs innovation, growth and prosperity,"" Yellen said.\nYellen\'s remarks came during a speech Monday before the Chicago Council on Global Affairs as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank Group kick off a new round of spring meetings this week. This is Yellen\'s first participation in the meetings as Treasury secretary.\nWhile the Biden administration is calling for a global minimum tax, a Treasury official would not give a specific number for what the target minimum is, only saying that the U.S. is looking to reach a comprehensive agreement on corporate taxation with other major economies. The G20 is aiming to reach a political agreement by July.\xa0\nThe Treasury official acknowledged that some countries may not agree to a deal but argued there are a number of provisions in the Made in America Tax Plan to help address tax havens and the U.S. is working with major partners as well. The tax proposal is part of the president\'s American Jobs Plan, unveiled last week, which would pay for infrastructure including roads, bridges and airports but also affordable housing, broadband and other provisions. As part of his plan, the president is also calling for upping the minimum tax on U.S. multinational corporations from 10.5% to 21%, which would be calculated on a country-by-country basis to help hit profits in tax havens.\nAccording to the Tax Foundation, the average corporate tax rate across 177 different jurisdictions in 2020 was just under 24%. The regional average was lower in Europe – just under 20% — and higher in in Africa, at 28.5%. With the Trump 2017 tax law, the U.S. brought its corporate tax closer to the average, from 35% to 21%.\nYellen has spent the past week briefing House and Senate leaders on Biden\'s tax plan. According to the administration, the tax plan would raise more than cover paying for the $2 trillion infrastructure plan over 15 years, in part by reversing some of the Trump administration tax cuts. Yellen will also brief House Democrats on Tuesday.\nOn Monday, Yellen also laid out other global cooperation priorities including addressing climate change, fighting inequality, working with partners to advance the global economic recovery from the pandemic, and making sure the world\'s poorest countries have access to vaccines and financing.\nThe Treasury secretary said the Biden administration is committed to restoring U.S. leadership to help make the world economy stronger and advance American interests, stating the U.S. needs a strong presence in the global market and would cooperate with willing partners, but she did not shy away from the challenges, specifically China.\n""Our economic relationship with China, like our broader relationship with China, will be competitive where it should be, collaborative where it can be, and adversarial where it must be,"" Yellen said.\nDuring Monday\'s speech, Yellen highlighted the sharp shift from the previous administration\'s approach on the world stage, saying America is strongest when it engages with the world.\xa0\n""Over the last four years, we have seen firsthand what happens when America steps back from the global stage,"" Yellen said. ""America first must never mean America alone.""\n© 2021 CBS Interactive Inc.

Gonzaga-red from the videoboard on the scorer\'s table lighting up his face as he eyed the prey.\xa0 \nGonzaga had no idea what was coming.\xa0 \nLess than five minutes later, it sure as hell did. Mitchell  who hit the game\'s first shot and set the tone for a definitive roasting that would come over the next two hours  and his teammates stepped onto the floor as though they were fired out of a cannon. Blink and it\'s 11-1, Bears. Turn your head and now it\'s 16-4. Baylor gave Mark Few\'s team its largest deficit of the season less than 10 minutes into the night and never looked back.\xa0 \nGonzaga was shell-shocked.\xa0 \nBaylor\'s men\'s basketball team captured its first national championship with an 86-70 razing that amounted to one of the most impressive title-game performances in recent college basketball history.\xa0 \nFinal Four hero Jalen Suggs had foul trouble early and was wobbled immediately thanks to Mitchell. Drew Timme had his table overturned multiple times. Most Outstanding Player Jared Butler finished with a game-high 22 points and seven assists, becoming the first player since Carmelo Anthony in 2003 to have 20-and-7 in a title game. Here in Indianapolis, where UNLV\'s undefeated run expired vs. Duke in the 1991 Final Four and where Kentucky\'s chase for immortality vanished vs. Wisconsin\xa0in 2015, Monday night was Gonzaga\'s turn to see its perfect season go poof.\xa0 \nBaylor blows out Gonzaga in shocking, dominant fashion. A championship edition of Eye on College Basketball recaps the national championship game. \nAnd there was Scott Drew. Leaping into the arms of his staff. College basketball\'s happiest coach on his happiest night. When it was over, Drew brought everyone into a huge circle on the court. They kneeled and said a prayer. \nThe greatest program reinvention in men\'s college basketball history was complete. \nDrew took the Baylor job in 2003 when the program was near disintegration. The job Drew\'s done at Baylor in the 18 years since  impressive is an understatement. There was no set of instructions when he got there, because there wasn\'t even a drawer to put them in. This was not a rebuild; what Baylor could be, in 2003, was a figment of Drew\'s imagination.\xa0 \n""I don\'t know if I was the first choice,"" Drew told CBS Sports last season, shortly after the Bears had climbed to the top and were No. 1 in the country. \nBut Baylor was his first choice. Just 32 years old then, Drew was doe-eyed but determined. A widely shared video by the Baylor men\'s basketball Twitter account shows Drew\'s hope and vision all those yesterdays ago, when he said winning a national championship on his watch was possible.\xa0 \nHe probably honestly believed it then, and he probably honestly was the only person on earth who did.\xa0 \nComing off a scandal that included the murder of a player by one of his teammates and a cover-up by the former coach that included the defaming of the murdered player, Baylor was radioactive. Drew was down to six scholarships his first year. A walk-on\'s dream  because they played.\xa0 \nAn NCAA investigation from the Dave Bliss era would eventually lead to sanctions that didn\'t even allow the program to play nonconference games in Drew\'s third season. The Bears went 4-13. The NCAA\'s punishment was one-of-a-kind for men\'s basketball. \nYet within two years of that abridged season Drew had Baylor in the NCAA Tournament, the first of what is now nine appearances. \nSmiling the whole way. Always has. About that, though.\xa0 \n""The guy at Baylor."" \nA quote that\'s stuck with me for almost 10 years. It\'s July 2012 and I\'m leaning against the wooden bleachers at the Nike Peach Jam. There are a few coaches holding court and gossiping while half-watching another game larded with four- and five-star prospects.\xa0 \n""The guy at Baylor,"" one of them said.\xa0 \nHe pointed, too. Drew was sitting on the other side of the gym, dressed as he almost always is on the recruiting trail: long-sleeve black shirt with big-lettered BAYLOR in neon-green across the chest. The confidence and casual nature of the accusation has always stuck with me. Didn\'t matter if it was true or not. Drew knew this was how some coaches talked about him then. Had to. Baylor had gone from the trash heap to Big 12 competitor in a short time. Too short of a time for some.\xa0 \n""We\'re all human,"" Drew told CBS Sports. ""Everybody would rather be complimented than criticized. When you get criticized, no it doesn\'t feel good. But at the same time, in coaching you\'re either criticized because you can recruit but can\'t coach, or you can coach and can\'t recruit. Over time you hopefully show you can do both."" \nDrew grew the ire of institutional pillars early in his Baylor career. Bobby Knight went after him, and so did Rick Pitino and Rick Barnes. He was too happy, too peppy. Seemingly: too phony. He was getting players Baylor wasn\'t supposed to get. This reputation dogged him for a time.\xa0 \n""I think it bothered me a lot more than it bothered him,"" Bryce Drew, his brother, said. \nTen years ago, Baylor\'s success landing a few highly rated recruits led to some coaches casually accusing him of cheating because of, among other things, who he tried to hire on his staff. It led to an NCAA investigation that was known but fairly hush-hush. Nothing major ever came of it. But it took Drew years to shed some stigma. He\'d never let on that it bothered him, though. At least not publicly.\xa0\n""We went through a three-year NCAA investigation, and I think that\'s when people stopped making allegations about us,"" Drew said. ""It\'s not fun to go through, just so you know.""\xa0 \nIt got so bad, people connected to recruits would go to Baylor looking for handouts, assuming that was the game. Sometimes $30,000 or $50,000. A car, a job, anything. Drew said none of it ever happened. But he was a case study in how rumormongering can set back, if not ruin, a program. Many people in Drew\'s position would have scooted out for another job. Drew stayed. Whether or not cheating actually occurred at Baylor under Drew, that can never fully be known. But the NCAA\'s investigation turned over nothing close to what was whispered. It still didn\'t stop the slandering behind his back.\xa0 \nI know because I heard it.\xa0 \n""I couldn\'t control that noise, or what other people might say,"" Drew said. ""I know the truth."" \nHe changed his recruiting approach, but he never changed his outlook. Drew became less interested in landing the best players and instead pivoted toward getting the best players for Baylor. A quiet reinvention took place, and in recent years the school found its formula. Drew and his staff were willing to take anyone from anywhere. And so they did.\xa0 \nDavion Mitchell from Auburn. \nMaCio Teague from UNC Asheville. \nAdam Flagler from Presbyterian. \nJonathan Tchamwa Tchatchoua from UNLV.\xa0 \nA once-chubby kid named Jared who\'d go on to put on an all-time performance in the biggest game of Baylor men\'s basketball.\nThey\'d be the ones to break Gonzaga\'s heart.\nOn Monday night Baylor became the third team in men\'s basketball history to knock off an undefeated team in a national championship game, joining 1961 Cincinnati and 1979 Michigan State. It did so by bringing in an eclectic combination of mature, muscular, mentally focused players who were capable of more than they knew when they got to Baylor.\xa0 \nDrew\'s optimism never wavered. He never let the noise get to him. And now, Baylor\'s playing as well as any power-conference program. It\'s one of only two schools in a major conference in the past 13 years to win at least 18 games every season. The other is Kansas. \nReflecting immediately upon the beatdown Baylor bludgeoned the Bulldogs with Monday night, that 21-day February COVID pause might have been the only thing standing in the way of an undefeated season. The Bears lost two games, both of which came after the team emerged from its quarantine cocoon.\xa0 \nEven though Baylor couldn\'t go undefeated, knocking off an undefeated in the ultimate game is the next best thing. Who\'d have believed it? The 50-year-old in the hat on a ladder, net in hand, who saw this moment in his mind at 32. On Monday night he and his team scaled the mountaintop, and in ending perfection, showed the closest thing to it. \n""Hurdle after hurdle after, but he never questioned whether it could be done,"" his father, Homer, a coaching legend in his own right, told CBS Sports. ""The biggest thing of why is because he enjoys working with young people and helping them grow to become good citizens, later in life. So, yes, winning\'s important, because you have to win to keep your job. The thing I\'m most proud of is how he has touched the lives of his players not only this year, but within that struggle to get them up and you can see a lot of these people are alumni who have come back to honor him for that."" \nFew people expected Scott Drew to make it to 2008 at Baylor. Then 2008 became 2012, and then 2016. But it\'s 2021 and he\'s rolling and pushing past many who for years believed he\'d never make it to the first Monday night in April.\xa0 \nHe\'s on top of college basketball. Drew might have the biggest smile in the sport now, but he also has the worst grip; the man has seemingly never held a grudge. Monday night could have been about personal redemption and told-you-sos, but that is not Scott Drew. Less than five minutes after winning the title, he made his way over to the press bay parked 20 feet behind the baseline. He took a minute to thank the media for its coverage and belief in his program, in him.\xa0 \nFor years, his so-called act irked some. Who could be this happy all the time? But it is no act. This is who he is. Drew never changed, and because of that, his program could. What was once a figment of his imagination is now material reality.

14,"('multiple', None, None, [""\nIt's Masters week, which means everybody needs a horse to back at Augusta National Golf Club for the first major championship of 2021. For many, the choices are easy. Maybe you're a diehard and have been following since shots were in the air at the Safeway Open last fall. You're on Daniel Berger because of how he played at the Pebble Beach Pro-Am or Abraham Ancer because you have him in your one-and-done league (not sure why you would have Ancer in a one-and-done league this week, but to each their own).\nFor many others, however, this is the start to the golf year. A lot has changed since golf last operated on its normal schedule, and some of this may be unfamiliar.\xa0 Two years ago, Collin Morikawa, Viktor Hovland and Matthew Wolff were still amateurs and Tiger Woods was among the favorites for this tournament (which he won). Tiger won't be there this time around, but the other three could all win it. Some even made this list, which includes several stars who have unique angles to their stories in this specific week.\nHere's a look at nine golfers that are worth cheering for when the golf gets underway early on Thursday at the 85th edition of the Masters. Odds via William Hill Sportsbook.\nSpieth will be the No. 1 storyline this week for so many reasons following his win at the Texas Open on Sunday. A traipse through the valley for three years (he'd failed to win since the 2017 Open Championship) followed by the high of sitting in Butler Cabin again on Sunday evening would be almost too much to take in (for him and us). He was easy to root for before, but now he's even more human, even more relatable. He shows you everything going on inside of him every time out, which is both intoxicating and tiring. It's hard not to pull for somebody who constantly showed you his heart even when it was barely beating. Odds: 12-1I wrote after he won in 2020 that he has become maybe the\xa0most endearing superstar\xa0in the game today. Only three golfers  Tiger Woods, Nick Faldo and Jack Nicklaus  have ever won back-to-back Masters. D.J. would be a worthy fourth, and it would be sweet for him to get green jacket No. 2 on a course that is more full of fans this time around. In some ways, he actually deserves that moment again because of how good he was on an empty course five months ago. Odds: 9-1The always affable Norwegian is the easiest player in the field to like. He'll shoot 77 with a smile on his face and cackle when he chunks a chip. If your boyfriend or grandma is looking to roll with somebody who perpetually looks like he cannot believe he gets to play a game for millions of dollars every week, Hovland is the guy. Odds: 33-1This is an easy one this year because the narrative around the often-irritable Rahm entering the Masters was whether he would actually leave the grounds to attend the birth of his first child. Good news! Baby Rahm was born happy and healthy a couple days early, and Rahm is expected to make it to Augusta National. Swaddling baby Rahm in a green jacket would be nifty. Odds: 12-1McIlroy is not a tragic figure by any means, but when he's approaching 18 months since winning on the PGA Tour  and, oh yeah, once again vying for the grand slam  I think it can become even easier to pull for him to somehow seal the deal that now seems to be so elusive at a track where nobody has ever finished the slam. Odds: 14-1Hovland but American (and better). Morikawa's electric smile is only outpaced by his even more electric swing. He's played his way into the role of best American golfer under 25 and already has a major under his belt. He seems like he genuinely enjoys the game in the way maybe only a 24-year-old raking in seven-figure checks on the regular possibly can. Like he cannot believe it is his good fortune to be born with this swing at this moment in time and like he never wants any of it to end. Odds: 30-1Maybe the kindest player on the PGA Tour has become one of its biggest on-course assassins. That's a fun combination to cheer on, especially since it always seemed so improbable that mild-mannered Webb Simpson would ever grow into this specific role. Odds: 35-1Finau is cursed by begin good enough to matter every week but never good enough to win. It's a purgatorial state that may only be exorcised by winning a major championship decisively on a Sunday. He'd be an easy dude to root for in contention late. Odds: 33-1Westwood is nearly two years older than Nicklaus when Jack won the Masters in 1986 and would be one of the oldest major championship winners of all-time. There's a pretty decent case to be made that the 48-year-old Englishman is the most accomplished player in the history of the sport without a major. His resurgence in the first quarter of the golf year rekindled in us a specific love for watching somebody who's seen it all see that, indeed, he still holds a bit of magic he might not have known was still in there.

Lashley was looking to dispatch of his second former Hurt Business member in as many weeks when he took on Cedric Alexander. In addition, McIntyre took on SmackDown\'s King Corbin following the latter\'s assault of McIntyre last week.\nCBS Sports was with you all night, bringing you recaps and highlights of all the action from the ThunderDome inside Tropicana Field.\nDrew McIntyre started off the night and reflected on the past year as WrestleMania draws near. McIntyre said that this is going to be the ""biggest fight of our lives"" and he and Bobby Lashley will tear each other apart. He said his purpose was to come to WWE and become WWE champion, and he didn\'t have the luxury of going home. McIntyre said his mother inspired him to keep pushing forward even after being originally fired by WWE. He asked Lashley how he can ""beat a man that sacrifices everything."" He vowed to win back the WWE championship.\nLashley interrupted McIntyre and said that McIntyre\'s time is over. He said that he saw fear in McIntyre\'s eyes when he put him in the Hurt Lock last week, and there\'s nothing McIntyre can do about it. McIntyre responded by saying that the two should just fight right now, but MVP said that isn\'t happening. MVP said that McIntyre will ultimately lose the match, but that will happen on Saturday. McIntyre proclaimed he will ""run down"" Lashley and get back his WWE title. MVP told McIntyre he might not even make it to WrestleMania before King Corbin came out.\nCorbin said he doesn\'t know why McIntyre is worried about WrestleMania because he may not make it there. He added that he plans to take down McIntyre, so there won\'t be a WrestleMania for him.\nDrew McIntyre def. King Corbin via pinfall\xa0with a Claymore.\xa0McIntyre came out looking to dominate Corbin as he showcased his physicality throughout a large amount of the match. MVP was on commentary during the match and handed Corbin his cane to take out McIntyre. However, McIntyre was able to sidestep the cane and pick up the win. Following the match, Lashley came out and McIntyre stared him down. McIntyre pointed at the WrestleMania sign as Raw went off the air.\nMcIntyre had to stand tall prior to WrestleMania to give the babyface some momentum. Obviously, McIntyre wasn\'t losing this match, and having MVP attempt to toss Corbin his cane was a nice touch. Now the stage is set for two behemoths to do battle at WrestleMania in a match that\'s expected to be an absolute classic.\xa0Grade: B\nCLAYMORE to @BaronCorbinWWE for the win!Will this be the scene for @DMcIntyreWWE at #WrestleMania with the #WWEChampionship on the line?#WWERaw pic.twitter.com/1DV74U9OVw\nXavier Woods def.

Styles ended up getting distracted and Woods rolled him up for the victory.Braun Strowman def. Elias and Jaxson Ryker via pinfall\xa0with running powerslams. Before the match, Strowman said that Shane McMahon doesn\'t know what he\'s gotten himself into. Strowman said that when the steel cage door shuts, he\'s locked in there with a monster. At WrestleMania, Strowman vowed McMahon will leave in a body bag. McMahon came out and said that a steel cage match is ""not that stupid,"" and he will outwit Strowman in their steel cage match. After WrestleMania, McMahon said that Strowman will feel ""stupid"" after he loses.Miz and John Morrison smeared red paint all over Bad Bunny\'s white Bugatti. Bad Bunny returned to his car to check on it as Miz ambushed him. Miz and Morrison then beat down Bad Bunny.

It happened on an extended follow-through while striking out in the third inning against the Giants\xa0on Monday. Fernando Tatis immediately crumpled to the ground, favoring his left arm.\nFernando Tatis Jr. went back to the clubhouse after hurting himself on this swing pic.twitter.com/iQh81fkwjU\nA subluxation, for those without a medical dictionary handy, is a partial dislocation, and for a ball-and-socket joint like the shoulder, there can be some collateral damage. The Padres say they\'ll know more Tuesday, probably awaiting MRI results, but at this point, the question is whether he\'s out 4-6 weeks or 4-6 months. Dr. Jesse Morse of The Fantasy Doctors thinks it\'ll more likely be the latter:\nPartial shoulder dislocation confirmed for #Tatis. Shame. Expect surgery to repair torn labrum, and depending on the severity, RTP 4-6 months. Will record new video in AM. 😥 https://t.co/fL77K1Z4bf\nIt\'s going to be a while either way, and given the stature of the player and all the ways he can contribute for a Fantasy team, it might have you thinking of waving the white flag.\nKeep in mind, though, that Fantasy Baseball lineups are large, with all corners representing a possibility for production. You could make a more convincing case that your team lives and dies with a single player in Fantasy Football, but the baseball season is much longer and the paths to success much more diverse. All you need are a few lucky breaks  or not even luck, really, but a few clutch pickups  to patch a hole as big as the one Tatis leaves behind.\nIt\'ll take more effort, with a few more lumps along the way, but it\'ll be that much more rewarding when you pull it off.\nLet\'s first consider some direct replacements at shortstop, provided you don\'t already have one lined up. Of course, you\'d rather not have to look beyond your own roster given that the talent at this position is concentrated at the top, with few upside plays beyond the early-round studs. But ""few\' doesn\'t mean ""none.""\nLet\'s start with Ha-seong Kim, the player who\'ll likely be replacing Tatis in San Diego. He arrived to great fanfare after starring in South Korea but became an ill-fitting part once the NL nixed the DH. His transition to the majors has been a slow one, judging by him going 7 for 42 (.167) with no extra-base hits and 15 strikeouts in spring training, but that\'s not uncommon for players from the Far East who have to adapt to higher velocities and a different style of play overall. More reps can only do him good, and you need only look at his KBO numbers to know there\'s upside in there.\nWe discuss Tatis scenarios and a lot more on the Fantasy Baseball Today in 5 Podcast. You can follow us to make sure you get the latest episodes when they drop on Apple, Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts.\nAVG.306OPS.921It\'s also possible, particularly with Trent Grisham on the mend, that Jurickson Profar claims most of Tatis\' at-bats, taking over at second base while shifting Jake Cronenworth to shortstop. Profar has had an up-and-down career, but he performed at a near 20-20 pace during the pandemic-shortened season. Obviously, steals are part of what you\'re looking to replace with Tatis.\nAVG.278OPS.771 St. Louis L.A. DodgersIf you just lost Tatis and are looking for a miracle solution, Wander Franco might be your best hope. He may be only 10 days or so away from debuting, and as the top prospect in baseball, there\'s a chance he could deliver a stud outcome right away. Bobby Witt is worth rostering in the same vein, though the wait for him figures to be longer given how little minor-league experience he has. If you\'re really in a pinch in a deeper league, stashing away\xa0Nico Hoerner or Jeter Downs\xa0for later isn\'t such a bad idea either.\nInterest in Andres Gimenez has cooled because of a slow start, but he still projects for a healthy stolen base total with a possibility for some modest pop. Jorge Polanco should be an all-around serviceable hitter, but without much speed. Paul DeJong remains a good bet for power.\nOK, so slim pickings there, but what if you\'re just hoping to approximate Tatis\' production at any position? It\'s still a tall task, but the list of candidates is longer.\nC.J. Cron L.A. Angels Chi. White SoxYou should take a long, hard look at Akil Baddoo, a Rule 5 pick who just started his second straight game for the Tigers, homering in both and swiping a bag in one. He did this after hitting .325 (13 for 40) with five homers, four steals and a .460 on-base percentage in spring training. Maybe at 22, he proves to be overmatched in the long run, but if upside is the aim, he\'s the target.\nOther pickups capable of a five-category outcome (or at least the power/speed combo) include Nick Senzel, Jazz Chisholm, Michael Taylor, Josh Rojas, Brendan Rodgers, Taylor Trammell and Sam Hilliard  and I\'d prioritize them in that order. If you\'re just looking for a bat, there\'s a chance the White Sox have really found something in Yermin Mercedes, who has collected 11 hits in his past four games. Alex Kirilloff and Jarren Duran are two players who you might consider stashing away in the hope of an eventual call-up.\nOf course, you could go the trade route as well, but you probably won\'t find many eager participants so early in the season. Maybe you can float an offer for Adalberto Mondesi and try to wait out his injury, particularly if Tatis\' timetable turns out to be on the longer side. Maybe the modest production so far from Gleyber Torres, Javier Baez and Carlos Correa will allow you to pry one of them away, especially given their 2020 struggles, but that sort of play probably wouldn\'t work outside of shallower leagues with casual participants.\nThe bottom line, though, is you can make it work. The way seems fuzzy right now, but if you stay committed to corralling upside on the waiver wire, eventually a player or two will break through for you.\n'])",sports,https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/baseball/news/fantasy-baseball-injury-reaction-fernando-tatis-likely-out-a-while-with-shoulder-subluxation-what-now/

It\'s clear what the Italian Renaissance looked like, but in the soaring Santa Maria Novella Basilica, ""CBS Sunday Morning"" got the rare chance to hear how it sounded, with music being heard for the first time in more than 400 years.\nMark Spyropoulos is director of Music and the Medici, and chief dreamer in this effort to unearth the until-now-unknown sacred music of this family who ruled this part of Italy 500 years ago. \n""If you look at the artists that are produced at this time, it\'s a roll-call of the greatest artists in Western history: Leonardo da Vinci, Botticelli, Michelangelo, Raphael, the list just goes on and on of these incredible names,"" Spyropoulos \xa0said. ""Really, they had no idea about music? That to me seems impossible.""\n""Well, that\'s what we\'re working out.""\nA rehearsal of sacred music dating from the 1500s, at the Santa Maria Novella Basilica in Florence.\xa0 \xa0His journey to ""work that out"" started back when he was singing at the Vatican as part of the so-called ""Pope\'s choir."" That\'s where, in 2018, we first met this British baritone, who reflected on the music, ""We say, consider something beyond this world, beyond the everyday."" \nSpyropoulos told Doane, ""When I was singing in the Sistine Chapel, and we were uncovering music from the Vatican archives, this made me think about archives and the potential for archives in other parts of Italy."" \nIt was actually a reasonable question to pose to Assonitis, the director of the Medici Archive Project in Florence. \n""What the archive is, is one long story,"" Assonitis said, ""a story made up of millions and millions of narratives of a family that had an impact unlike no other family.""\nThe project, which is funded mostly by Americans, is working to make accessible the more than three million letters and other documents which belonged to this powerful family, who were patrons of the arts (and pretty much everything). \nEvidence of the Medicis\' influence is everywhere in Florence. But Assonitis said the music may have simply fallen out of fashion – and so now, in the archive, they\'re uncovering a ""new monument"" here. \nAssonitis showed Doane 16th century letters written to the Medici family seeking patronage: ""A lot of artists, a lot of musicians, but also a lot of cooks and cobblers and all sorts of people write to the Duke saying, \'Here\'s what I\'ve done.\' Usually, in the case of music, \'Here is my mass, or my motets, you know, can you finance them?\'""\nThe job of finding these manuscripts falls to musicologist Giordano Mastrocola. He usually scours Florence\'s vast state archives, but with COVID restricting access, Doane met him at the Santa Maria Novella Library. There, Mastrocola opened a massive music book from the late 1200s, which pre-dates the Medici. But in his search, sometimes it\'s a random find that\'s most intriguing.\nA music book from the 1200s.\xa0""Yes, exactly,"" he replied. ""Sometimes they could insert some new music at the end of the book.""\nMastrocola would take a digital picture of a find, and send it to Spyropoulos, who then, note-by-note, transcribes the music, which was written down in separate parts.\n""When we print modern music, they\'re stacked on top of each other – soprano, alto, tenor, bass,"" Spyropoulos explained. ""But at this time, they would write out each part individually. So, that\'s a bit like having a play with all the words of one character written out completely, and then the next character and the all the things that they say written out completely…""\nMark Spyropoulos transcribes the music to modern notation.\xa0But as he places the notes of the various parts onto modern sheet music, the piece starts to emerge. ""You really get the sense of what the composer is doing, and I can start to hear back how this music works,"" he said. \nWhen there\'s enough to try out, Spyropoulos practices the individual part with singers. \nIt\'s music that\'s quite different from what we\'re used to hearing today. \n""Any pop song has the tune that everyone sings along, you know, we all know the tune, and then underneath is the music that supports the tune,"" he said. ""This music doesn\'t work like that. Here you have one, two, three, four, five, up to 10 melodic lines, so essentially, different songs which are put together.""\nDoane got a chance to hear that at a special rehearsal Spyropoulos set up to test the songs.\nMark Spyropoulos leads a rehearsal of sacred music of the Italian Renaissance that has not been heard in more than four hundred years. \xa0""Oh, absolutely – it\'s like looking at a picture in black-and-white and then seeing it in color for the first time,"" Spyropoulos said. \nAnd for the first time, likely in hundreds of years, those notes – just ink marks recovered from an old book – were brought to life again. \n""Ultimately, the goal is to find, publish, perform and record this music,"" said Spyropoulos. ""It\'s not enough that we just create new books of it. Music has to be heard. My real ambition is that we might find amongst all of this something close to a masterpiece.""\n\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Story produced by Anna Matranga and Aria Shavelson.

His eight in total this season is the best (excluding penalties) of any midfielder in the league, better even than Manchester United\'s Bruno Fernandes.He has become one of the key players - perhaps the key player - in a transformation that has taken West Ham to sixth in the Premier League and the realistic prospect of Champions League qualification. He has become a fans\' favourite, working well alongside Declan Rice, and brings defensive solidity, aggression and a potent attacking presence. but not so long ago he was unwanted and found himself training between blocks of flats.Six years ago, when Soucek was 19 and at a pivotal point in his bid to become a professional footballer, hardly anyone believed in him.He had trials in the Czech Republic\'s second tier in January 2015, but two clubs - Vlasim and Frydek-Mistek - did not want to sign him. Soucek, who was still Slavia Prague\'s player, was then taken on loan by Viktoria Zizkov, largely because he was available for free.Zizkov had financial problems and had to improvise with their squad. They tried to get players from bigger clubs on loan but failed and then Slavia offered them Soucek, who had been in their academy since he was 10.When Zizkov\'s staff saw him in training they were not convinced.""It wasn\'t like he was overlooked by people - he just wasn\'t good enough,"" David Cermak, a journalist for Czech newspaper MF Dnes, tells BBC Sport.Zizkov\'s coach, Jindrich Trpisovsky, did not like him, but the club\'s general manager Ivan Hornik intervened. ""He said: \'Guys, he will come just for a loan and that\'s for free.\' So, Soucek stayed at Zizkov and worked the hardest of all,"" adds Cermak.Soucek was tall and when coaches watched him, they considered him to be slow. He played as a defensive midfielder, but his passing was not the best. In Slavia\'s academy, they tried to turn him into a centre-back, but the player has spoken of how he resisted any attempt to change his position. He has always admired Cesc Fabregas and Yaya Toure and saw himself as a central midfielder, too. Life with Zizkov was tough. They did not have enough money to pay for the maintenance of the pitch at their home stadium, so Trpisovsky decided to stage training sessions in a nearby park, located between apartment blocks.Players could be seen running in the long grass, while locals took their dogs for a walk just a few metres away. They were learning tactical formations among the trees. ""When the coach told us to do a forward roll, we didn\'t want to. We never knew what we would fall into,"" Soucek said in a 2019 interview.He played 14 games in the second division and returned to Slavia in the summer of 2015. Slavia were coached by Dusan Uhrin Jr and had big problems. ""Those were different times,"" Uhrin remembers. ""I came into the club and the previous season they finished 11th and were without money.""Tomas was lucky in that. We decided to bring all young players from loans back to Slavia because we had no money to buy new players.""Uhrin decided to put Soucek into the starting line-up in the first round of matches against Viktoria Plzen, the champions. ""I wasn\'t really convinced. I was worried about whether he could cope with it, but he began to score, even if he played as a defensive midfielder.""Under Uhrin, Soucek scored seven goals in 29 league games.Uhrin remembers a training session when one Slavia player tackled Soucek and injured him ""pretty badly"". ""We all got very nervous,"" he recalls. ""In that moment, I realised he was irreplaceable for us. I thought: \'What are we going to do now without him?\'""After a couple of months, I was talking with his agent and said that he might be good for the Bundesliga. He had that kind of movement, solidity and courage. The agent told me I was crazy.""Uhrin understood he had a special player, even if he was also sceptical at the start.""He didn\'t have good passing. Also, it didn\'t look very good when he was running. That might have been the reason why coaches didn\'t want him,"" he says.""But he was great in improving himself and working hard in training. He progressed really quickly, took responsibility and remained a great boy. You had to get used to watching him because at first glance he looked slow.""Uhrin describes Soucek as a quiet and shy boy who was a football fanatic and undertook extra training sessions. By working hard, a midfielder who never stood out in the academy suddenly became Slavia\'s key player.""He really looked weird on the pitch,"" adds journalist Cermak. ""He had an atypical body shape - looked quite clumsy - but then he did some surprise moves.""I never knew what to think about him. Then he scored a hat-trick against Banik Ostrava and that caught my attention, as he played as a defensive midfielder. Gradually, it was clear he was not a defensive midfielder at all.""In September 2015, CEFC China Energy Company bought Slavia and the club returned to the summit of the Czech league. Uhrin was sacked in August 2016 and Soucek left for another loan, at top-flight side Slovan Liberec. There, he met Trpisovsky again. A few months later they were both at Slavia - and Trpisovsky built his team around Soucek.In their first season, Slavia ended second behind Plzen and were then champions a year later, with Soucek scoring 13 goals in 34 games.Trpisovsky loved Soucek. He has described his protege as having ""a computer in his head"" and, under his guidance, Soucek became a regular in the national team. Slavia progressed to the Champions League group stage last season, where they had hard-fought battles with Barcelona, Inter Milan and Borussia Dortmund. in a Euro 2020 qualifier - a result which ended the Three Lions\' unbeaten record in qualifying stretching back 10 years - and was then one of the best players on the pitch as Slavia were unlucky to lose 2-1 against Barcelona.Soucek had shown he had no problem facing some of Europe\'s best midfielders. ""Trpisovsky knew well that Soucek was exceptional even by European standards,"" Cermak says. ""He tried to convince Slavia\'s bosses not to sell him for a low fee. Even West Ham\'s offer was too small, according to him.""The Hammers did get their man though, making him the most expensive player in the history of the Czech league.10 Premier League goals in only 33 appearances. Other Czech greats - all of them forwards or attacking midfielders - needed more games to reach that total: Tomas Rosicky 45, Patrik Berger 48 and Vladimir Smicer 107. Smicer, who played for Liverpool, has compared Soucek\'s style to Roy Keane and Patrick Vieira.Soucek has proved himself a versatile player, able to run relentlessly - his 12.2km covered on average per game is the highest in the league, along with Brighton\'s Pascal Gross - defend, cover space, and start and finish attacks. And it is that attacking prowess that has really caught the eye.Only three players - Everton\'s Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Mohamed Salah of Liverpool and Manchester United\'s Fernandes - have won their team more points with their goals in 2020-21.""He\'s a wee bit old-fashioned in many ways, but his attitude and commitment to the team is second to none,"" Hammers boss Moyes has said.Uhrin would not be surprised if reported interest from clubs competing in Europe materialises. ""He is constantly improving, so why not? Who scores eight goals from his position? I wouldn\'t expect a transfer to Bayern, but rather a team in England.""Big challenges lie ahead over the next few months. Can he inspire West Ham to a European place? And will he do damage to England when the teams meet in the group stages of this summer\'s European Championship? They have been warned.'])",sports,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/56001747

The Great Britain and Scotland cross country international is marking the date in the way she does every Tuesday night - continuing her father\'s legacy by using those notes to coach the same group he did. ""Coaching tonight, in some ways it\'s just really appropriate,"" she said. ""The majority of the kids in the athletics group I\'m working with were my dad\'s athletes. ""He worked with them for a couple of years actually, really developed their confidence as well as their ability. He put everything into it that he could to get the best out of people. ""After my dad died, my mum and I had a real time looking through the variety of coaching notes he left. My dad knew where everything was, but not necessarily everyone else did. ""So it was a case of looking for notes that were in bookmarks, within books; he really liked his notecards, and trying to consolidate all that together to really form a full picture was a bit of a challenge. ""But also a bit of a laughable moment for us, because it was like, \'right, okay, what did you mean by this?\' Right, let me try and put these pieces together like a jigsaw.""She added: ""I\'ve been coaching the kids for over a year, and some of them had a really successful cross country and track season, so I must be doing something right to help them move in that direction.""Before taking over as coach at Nithsdale Athletics Club, David Hood - who passed away last year - was as heavily involved in sport as he could be. He ran the first Glasgow Marathon, completed the Three Peaks Challenge and found time to be a fully-qualified rugby coach. But it was athletics where Nicola\'s father decided to put his energy, to help the same kids his daughter would one day coach. David\'s legacy endures - not just in the memories of Nicola and her group: there is another piece of him in every session. ""The whistle I use in my training was actually a Christmas present that I gave to my dad just a few months before he died,"" Nicola explains. ""I had it engraved with Coach Hood on the side, which is what he was known as at the track. ""He was chuffed at the time when I got him this, so it\'s really important to me, and holds quite a lot of sentimental value in having that at the track with me when I\'m doing the training sessions. Just keeps me strong at times that are tough. ""I know most people would say this about their dad, but my dad was genuinely my hero, he was my rock star: kind, giving, enthusiastic but honest and realistic as well I think, as a coach.""Nicola shows the same temperament as her father in her coaching session, as she cheers on her group, taking some of them to one side for tailored chats and managing to genuinely motivate a bunch of teenagers on a dreary autumn night. ""I honestly think he would be so proud, and just chuffed,"" she adds. ""Not just that I\'m continuing to pursue my coaching career, but that I\'m there to support the kids.""He really was committed to giving everything he could to them and the kids have become really important to me over time as well.

41,"('multiple', None, None, ['\nSnoozing in Nairobi airport\'s departure lounge in a navy blue suit, David Rudisha looks like just another businessman having a quick power nap. His fellow passengers seem pretty relaxed about being in the presence of Kenyan running royalty. My feelings are a little different.Appropriately for a man who has hardly been seen or heard from in the past three years, the two-time Olympic 800m champion Rudisha has been difficult to track down. at London 2012. It\'s a fuller face than you might remember.By his own admission, the 31-year-old has changed a lot since that incredible world record of one minute 40.91 seconds he set in winning Olympic gold, before defending his crown four years later in Rio.The initial problem was injury. A long-term issue with the tendon that attaches to the sitting bone means he has not run competitively since 4 July 2017.But Rudisha has had to cope with a lot more than that.Marital problems, separating from his wife, plus the death of his father Daniel - himself an Olympic medallist - last year left Rudisha looking for ""a bit of destruction to distract"".To release the pressure valve, he was ""partying too much"". When the injuries finally subsided and he was able to return to running in November, he did so two stone overweight.And then there is the reason why Rudisha feels he is living a ""second chance"" at life. He could easily have died last summer.Five hours into a six-hour drive to his family home in Kilgoris, south-west Kenya, Rudisha rounded a corner late at night to be confronted by a bus on his side of the road. They collided head-on.His car was a write-off. Recalling the memory, he recoils in his seat.""Actually I don\'t even have words to explain the accident,"" he says. ""It was really horrific and scary. It was not easy and everybody, every time, kept asking me: \'How did you even survive? How did you get out of that car?\'""To come out without a single scratch was just like a miracle. It is not something that happens every day, it was so special and I feel like God still loves me.""All of this explains why reducing weight, rather than lap times, is still top of the to-do list. However, a big goal is back on the table: the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.consecutive 800m Olympic titles. Nobody has won three - at all, let alone in a row.""I still feel like I still have something in me. I have not exhausted everything,"" he says.""There is something left in the tank and that is what I want to exhaust before I think of doing other things.""If you saw me one month ago I was a little bit heavier, but now I am losing the weight and the response is pretty good. The routine is back. When you miss out on training and competition for two years it is never easyâ\x80¦""Rudisha trails off. The question of what could happen if the old magic returns is left hanging.It\'s a tantalising thought. This is the man who after all, according to chairman Lord Coe, delivered the best performance of the entire London 2012 Olympics.""Bolt was good, Rudisha was magnificent,"" Coe said. ""That is quite a big call but it was the most extraordinary piece of running I have probably ever seen.""He had the balls to go in there and think: \'I am so much better than anyone else that I could [run a world record].\' In Olympic finals you are not supposed to gamble with the till, but he did.""Rudisha circa 2020 is more circumspect.The impact of three years of back-to-back injuries undoubtedly informs his current mantra, for which he dips into Swahili: ""Pole, pole (slowly, slowly).""I have had so many setbacks before so I don\'t want to rush into anything.""We are human beings, not machines. You cannot have a spare part of your leg or foot or whatever, but we have also to listen sometimes to our body.""Don\'t push, just try to be disciplined, doing the right thing at the right time. If the body responds and says yesâ\x80¦"" in October, Rudisha was open about turning to partying as a way to release the pressure he felt from his on and off-track issues. ""With everything else going on in my life, the pressure sometimes got to me,"" he said.""To release it I\'d often hang out with friends, partying too much. It\'s not something you intend to come your way but sometimes, during periods like that, you look for a bit of destruction to distract yourself.""Four months later he\'s a little more defensive.""Well, I, you know, I have never really directly spoken about partying but, you know, just a social life that everybody has the right to enjoy,"" is how he explains it now. ""Whenever we have a [athletics] meet, sometimes we go to socialise, to go out for instance. That is normal life.""I never meant anything extreme, because that is not what I do. Mostly I am a very focused person and disciplined. Sometimes when you have friends, you go out and throw a party and so forth, and that is actually what I meant.""Rudisha\'s penchant for a post-race party is, of course, entirely natural.But having spent two days earlier that week getting behind-the-scenes access to marathon world record holder Eliud Kipchoge\'s regime the contrast is striking.Life in Kipchoge\'s Spartan training camp in Kenya\'s Rift Valley is all work and no play. Kipchoge - and 30 other athletes - live in dormitories in Kaptagat from Monday to Saturday. Away from their families and other distractions their life is simple. Train, eat, rest, repeat.""Eliud\'s discipline is exceptional,"" Rudisha says. ""If you go back, Eliud can give you his training plan for the past two, three years. I don\'t think I have something like that.""I ask if that is not his way. Rudisha lets out a big laugh.""That\'s not my way. I do things more relaxed,"" he says.""I do so passionately. Running is something you have to enjoy sometimes. It is hard but you just have to enjoy and you have to make it look like fun.""To illustrate that more intuitive approach, Rudisha tells an anecdote about his pre-London 2012 training sessions.His world record time of 1:40.91, set in an Olympic final having already run heats and a semi-final, was arguably as stratospheric as Kipchoge\'s ""moon-landing moment"" last year when he became the first man to run a sub two-hour marathon.However, while Kipchoge had a team of hundreds of support staff who left no stone unturned in their search for perfection - climate, diet, training, trainers - Rudisha\'s key sessions before London 2012 didn\'t even feature a stopwatch.""At a certain point I just needed to do some splits with my mind,"" he says.] the watch. If I said I wanted to run 400m in 53, 54, 55 seconds I would do it, without the watch. It was amazing.""That is how I familiarised myself with timing. It was very natural and that is why I really mastered 800m very well, in such a way that I knew exactly what I was running for the first lap. It was just there in my mind.""It\'s easy to forget that Rudisha defended his London gold in Rio.In fact, the man himself made the same mistake during our conversation, talking about winning a second, rather than a third, Olympic title in Tokyo.That hat-trick would be an incredible athletic achievement for anyone. Given Rudisha\'s considerable issues both on and off the track for the past three years, it would be nothing short of a miracle.We met with less than six months to go until the Olympics and Rudisha was yet to set foot on a track. He was still building up his baseline fitness with 10-kilometre runs on the dirt roads around his home in Eldoret.But, crucially, eight years on from his greatest achievement, one of his greatest gifts has returned.""I am happy,"" he says. ""I missed the track and I missed training for the past two years. Sport is what I loved in my life. Whenever I am out there and training I feel like I am doing what I really truly love, and I am a passionate about it.""I know I have missed some of my best years and injury has robbed me. But I am looking forward.""If I make the team, go to Tokyo, qualify for the final and be in that final, yes I will say I will be standing there as a potential gold medallist, or medallist in that event. But before I get there I cannot start counting things that are not ready yet.""And with that the conversation is over.""Ladies and gentlemen, flight 8606 to Mombasa is ready for boarding. We apologise for the delay and any inconvenience caused.""The businessmen and women rush to gate three - visibly restless after what has been a lengthy delay.Not Rudisha. Ticket in hand, he slowly says goodbye and takes time to pose for a picture before joining the back of the queue.'])",sports,https://www.bbc.com/sport/athletics/51800436
42,"('multiple', None, None, ['\nIn 2015, Chinese hip-hop group Higher Brothers learned something the hard way: be very careful when your songs turn political.\nThe source of controversy was an anti-Uber song. “I don’t write political hip-hop,” spat out by the group’s rapper Melo. “But if any politicians try to shut me up, I’ll cut off their heads and lay them at their corpses’ feet. This time it’s Uber that’s investigated. Next time it will be you.” It led to the song being blocked by Chinese censors, and Melo called in for questioning by the local Public Security Bureau.\nSince then, Higher Brothers have garnered widespread success both at home and abroad, partly thanks to landing their first American tour to promote their album Journey To The West. Alongside many of China’s rising crop of hip-hop artists, they’ve stormed onto both the local and global stage – and largely steered clear of politics.\nUntil now. Over the course of the summer, as the Hong Kong protests have unfolded, and as geopolitical climes have chilled both at home and abroad, many of China’s rappers have decided to voice their politics.\n', '\nBut in stark contrast to the longstanding tradition of counter-culturalism and racial protest that has defined American hip-hop, the politics these rappers are asserting has a distinctly, one-noted nationalist tone.\nIn response to the protests, Melo posted a picture of the Chinese national flag on his social media accounts with the caption: “Once again, I’m proud to be Chinese.” The rapper CD Rev released a diss track titled Hong Kong’s Fall. Jackson Wang, a Hong Kong-born artist, declared on Weibo that he was a “flag bearer determined to side with China”.\nReactions have been polarised. Wang was accused of being a traitor by pro-democracy activists, then given a supportive pat on the back by Chinese state media\nIn hip-hop parlance, the “cipher” refers to the circle of participants closing around a group of battling rappers flexing their own skills and challenging each other’s ideas to win over an audience. The cipher is about competition, but most crucially, it’s about identity, a chance for the rapper to express where they stand and what they believe in.\nAt a moment in history when identifying “Chinese-ness” has never been so vigorously contested – both on a global scale and in people’s personal lives – it is no surprise that China’s rappers are stepping into the cipher. In doing so, they are raising a very basic question about identity: What does it mean to be Chinese?\n', '\nOnce, it felt like there was a cacophony of rap voices cutting across different ideologies, geographies and socio-economic classes – creatively competing for the hearts and minds of young Chinese. Chengdu rappers, Chongqing rappers and Changsha rappers. Rappers from the coasts of Guangzhou and the highlands of Gansu. Glitzy, cosmopolitan tunes from Shanghai and scrappy, rural tempos of the Northeastern “hanmai”. Hong Kong rappers, such as Fotan Laiki and Doughboy, spitting rhymes about a hometown in flux. Diaspora rappers like Bohan Phoenix, singing from the cracks of China and the United States.\nToday, the Chinese cipher seems to have ossified into binary themes – love and hate, anti-China vs pro-China, fervent nationalism vs treason to the nation – making it a zero-sum game in which conflict can only be resolved by the defeat of one side by the other. Artists like Wang, Melo and Vava, among so many others, seem have forgotten that the cipher is about competition, but also community, creativity and authenticity.\nInstead of creating a unique sense of self and perspective, they have decided to toe the line, parroting the Chinese authorities’ message.\n', '\nThis is not to say that all Chinese pride is uniformly expressed. Rapper GAI leading chants of Long Live the Motherland at the Spring Festival gala sponsored by state media is a very different brand of patriotism from the Higher Brothers’ breakout track Made In China. On one hand, the Higher Brothers’ song – about how Western products are now made in China – is indeed a bold assertion of Chinese pride. But the rappers are not boasting about China’s national sovereignty, replete with a red and yellow flag, but about the “jar of hot sauce so spicy that foreigners start to burn”.\nThe lyrics aren’t Mandarin, the language of national television, but Sichuanese, rich with rising and falling tones, which has great lyrical flow. Unlike the knee-jerk nationalism of Melo’s latest Instagram post, this playful, creative, hyperlocal pride is for the spicy food and free-wheeling attitude of its capital, Chengdu.\xa0\n', '\nTwo years ago, I visited Chengdu and sat in the studio of a group of young, aspiring rappers – TSP, from the outskirts of Sichuan; Rainbow and Skinnyoyo, from the flat, central grasslands of Xi’an and Shandong; Kong Kong, from the southern coast of Hong Kong; and Young13DBaby and Fendi Boi, from the northern mountains of Lhasa and Gansu.\nAs we sat together, shaking our heads to one of the group’s latest collaborations, I was struck by how smoothly they had woven together lyrics in Tibetan, Cantonese, Sichuanese, and Mandarin.\nThis scene of six boys, from six different regions of a nation of more than one billion, nodding their heads in unison to the beat of the music they had created together on their own, was the closest I have seen the Chinese cipher in its most platonic form – playful, inclusive, malleable – one song yielding the rich plurality of Chinese language and identity.\n', '\nHip-hop is a living, breathing culture – a reflection of the hopes and dreams of two generations of youth. Like those dreams, hip-hop music is supposed to be messy and full of contradictions. Can the Chinese hip-hop scene be a space where identities, even when contested, are not hardened in opposition to each other?\nIn an increasing polarised world, China’s hip-hop artists may find a new challenge – how to unite their audiences, instead of pushing them further apart.\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called The Essential List.

The choice eventually went to Norwegian pop trio A-ha, but the finished track from the “banger-crafting loveable uncles”, as BBC Culture calls them, is the very essence of the duo’s suburban ennui. a tale of rain-soaked misery at some nameless English school. It doesn’t take much to imagine this with swelling strings instead of synths in the background, its strangely Soviet grandeur just waiting to be unleashed.\n', '\nWhen the producers were looking for a song for Pierce Brosnan’s Tomorrow Never Dies, they were particularly proactive, asking several bands to contribute. One on the longlist was Pulp, the Britpop band who had become national treasure in the UK thanks to 1995’s Common People. In true Bond-ticking-timer tradition, apparently, they didn’t have much time to do it, either\n“It was weird. They set up a kind of\xa0American Idol situation, where they asked about nine different artists to come up with a Bond song,” frontman Jarvis Cocker told Time Out. They listen to nine different attempts of working “tomorrow never dies” into a lyric. We were told on a Wednesday that the deadline was Friday. Consequently, I was really pissed off when they went with Sheryl Crow instead.”\n', '\nRadiohead seem like the both the least likely band to hook themselves to the Bond trailer and the most natural: their bookish, literate take on rock more suited to arthouse productions than the bang-crash-explosion thrills and spills of Team Bond, yet containing within their ranks one of the best soundtrack composers working today.\nThis five-minute epic combines classy Jonny Greenwood classical chops with Thom Yorke’s voice at its most haunting, and a brass-and-string backing that sways like a drunken orchestra on a stormy sea. The band recorded it around the session for their 2016 album A Moon Shaped Pool; the Bond team decided, in the end, it was too dark. Though given the end result - Spectre’s opening sequence is a decidedly creepy affair, with Kraken-like octopuses and Mexican death masks – this was never going to be a job for the likes of Katy Perry.\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called The Essential List.

Then the song started moving units in the millions and climbed its way up the US Billboard charts, peaking at number 36 in 1980, and at number three on the UK Singles Chart. Rapper’s Delight wasn’t the first hip-hop song, but it was the genre’s commercial Big Bang, and a sign that this music born in the housing project hallways and public parks of the Bronx was more than a passing fad.\xa0\nHip-hop is pop culture now. The genre’s dominance of radio waves, streaming numbers, and billboard charts is undeniable, not to mention its influence on everything from avant-garde electronica to the DNA of mainstream pop music from artists like Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran and Ariana Grande.\xa0\nBut it’s more than that. Hip-hop has become a dominant cultural force, driving conversations about music, literature, and entertainment forward. Cardi B and Common are movie stars. Young Thug has created a wake of imitators that span genres and sounds. Kendrick Lamar won a Pulitzer Prize for his 2018 album DAMN. And it has become a truly global phenomenon, crossing ethnic, linguistic, and geographical boundaries. The journey from the turntables of DJ Kool Herc to the addictive, meme-ified sounds of Megan Thee Stallion and Lil’ Nas X was long, but hip hop is here to stay.\xa0\nWe asked 108 critics, artists, tastemakers, producers, and photographers from 15 different countries to name their personal top five hip-hop tracks of all time. There were more than 280 different songs named, a testament to the breadth and depth of the genre, and how the term ‘greatest’ can be interpreted in various ways.\xa0\nThe results are dominated by the so-called ‘Golden Age’ of hip-hop between the mid-80s and mid-90s, though there are some surprises from a more recent vintage with Kanye West’s Pusha T-assisted Runaway taking 12th place. There was a remarkable lack of women in the Top 25; only Queen Latifah’s 1993 hit “U.N.I.T.Y.” and Lauryn Hill’s supremely catchy “Doo Wop (That Thing)” appear in the list. (You can read more on the dearth of female MCs in our list here.) Rapper’s Delight, the track that arguably started it all, came in at number 14.\xa0\nThe full list of critics’ picks is below.

45,"('multiple', None, None, ['\nThis autumn sees the 80th anniversary of Wonder Woman, who made her comics debut in October 1941, two years after Batman and three years after Superman. But before we start celebrating, we should raise a glass to another, even more groundbreaking superheroine who swung into action six months earlier, in April 1941. Her name was Miss Fury. Written and drawn by June Tarpé Mills, she was the first superheroine to be created by a woman, which is one of many reasons why she is still so inspirational, eight decades on. Her devotees include Maria Laura Sanapo, an Italian comics artist. ""I think that the birth of Miss Fury can be considered the beginning of a new era,"" Sanapo tells BBC Culture.\nMills was born in Brooklyn, New York either in 1912 or 1918, according to different sources. Raised by her widowed mother and their relatives, she worked as a model and a fashion illustrator before selling her first comic strips in the late 1930s, featuring the escapades of such two-fisted swashbucklers as The Purple Zombie, Mann of India, and Daredevil Barry Finn (not to mention his amphibious sidekick, Frogga). But when Mills signed those strips, she dropped the ""June"" in favour of her androgynous middle name (her mother\'s maiden name), so that she would be known as Tarpé Mills. ""It would have been a major letdown to the kids if they found out that the author of such virile and awesome characters was a gal,"" she told the New York Post – a sentiment which would be echoed by Joanne Rowling nearly 60 years later when choosing the pen name JK.\n', '\nHowever Mills\'s true identity didn\'t stay hidden for long. Her big break was a weekly Sunday newspaper strip about someone who was just as awesome as Daredevil Barry Finn – but who, the publicity materials emphasised, borrowed her indomitable personality and her glamorous, raven-haired looks from Mills herself. The first Miss Fury strips (or rather, Black Fury strips, until Mills changed the title shortly afterwards) are a sort of distaff pastiche of Batman. They introduce Marla Drake, a New York socialite who is about to go to a fancy-dress party in a frilly red Scarlett O’Hara gown when a friend phones to say that someone else has picked the same outfit. Over-reacting slightly, Marla shreds the dress with her bare hands, thus affording readers a glimpse of her stockings and suspenders, but her understandably perturbed French maid Francine has a suggestion: ""Why not wear the black leopard skin your uncle left you?"" Presumably, Mills was getting panthers and leopards mixed up. She also falls back on the exoticising clichés of the time and establishes that the skin was a ceremonial robe worn by an African witch doctor. But it just so happens to be a slinky jumpsuit, complete with cat-eared mask, claws and tail. This, don\'t forget, was a quarter of a century before Catwoman and Black Panther began wearing almost identical costumes – and in French, incidentally, the character was called La Panthère Noire.\n', '\nMarla learns that the skin-tight ceremonial robe is ""endowed with strange powers which enabled its wearer to accomplish whatever mission he or she set out upon"". All of a sudden, she is outsmarting and outfighting tough guys in suits and trilbies, and her crime-busting exploits are hitting the gossip columns: ""This black-clad venus must be a veritable feline fury!"" But a strip that promises to be a hardboiled New York-gangster serial gets more outlandish and outrageous at breathtaking speed. Within a few weeks, Marla is entangled in the blackmail schemes of the gold-digging Baroness Erica Von Kampf, whose triangular fringe hides a swastika that has been branded on her forehead. Within a few more, Marla is teaming up with an albino Brazilian tribesman, and defeating the army of General Bruno, a monocled Nazi who lost an arm in an explosion after he taped a bomb to Marla\'s pet cat. ""It really felt as though anything could happen,"" says Mike Madrid, the author of\xa0The Supergirls: Fashion, Feminism, Fantasy, and the History of Comic Book Heroines. ""Comics were usually aimed either at boys or girls in the 1940s, but Mills\xa0mashed up genres to make a unique hybrid of superhero, romance, adventure, western and war comic.""\nMiss Fury herself was unique, too. ""She doesn\'t have a lot of physical strength, so she uses her intelligence to find ways to fight back,"" says Chelsea Stone, the director of a new documentary about Mills. ""She thinks on her feet. She\'s also a hopeless romantic who loves fashion. I think a lot of female characters were and still are one-dimensional, but Tarpé Mills knew that real women aren\'t like that, and she created her characters accordingly.""\nMarla was a proudly modern, proto-feminist heroine. She had various handsome suitors who pined for her rather than the other way around; she had a job in fashion design; and she even adopted her arch-enemy\'s toddler and became a single, unmarried mother – a status that was unheard of in comics at the time. ""She stood for all the women of that period,"" says Sanapo, ""who had a role in the reconstruction of their country while the men were at war"".\n', '\nBesides, you couldn\'t blame Marla for leaving her black costume in the cupboard when she had a seemingly endless supply of fabulous 1940s clothes to choose from. As well as its unpredictable plotting and its independent leading lady, the strip\'s appeal had a lot to do with Mills\'s intricate drawings of the trendiest suits, shoes, hats and dresses. Whether she is parachuting from a burning plane, or wrestling with the Baroness on a penthouse balcony, Marla sports nothing but the finest in figure-hugging haute couture. ""I love how practical Marla Drake is even when she\'s wearing the most dazzling gown,"" says Corinna Bechko, the writer of numerous Star Wars, Alien and Wonder Woman comics.\xa0""Mills proved that a woman could write and draw a comic strip, include things that are traditionally thought of as feminine, like fashion and motherhood, and still have the heroine be a total badass.""\nNaturally, wearing all of those different dresses meant that Marla had to get changed regularly: Mills often depicts her and and the Baroness swanning around their apartments in their lingerie, and luxuriating in their baths, so the strip offered far more titillating beauties than Batman or Wonder Woman ever did. The censors weren\'t always pleased. When one of Marla\'s statuesque associates squeezed into a leaf-patterned bikini for a nightclub performance, several newspapers opted either to cover her torso with a blob of red ink, or to shelve that week\'s strip altogether. But readers were delighted by these painstakingly drawn, cartoonishly proportioned women: Mills sent Miss Fury pin-ups to World War Two servicemen, and the character was painted on the noses of three American bombers.\n', '\nAs beloved as the strip was, though – at one point it was syndicated in 100 newspapers – it was cancelled in 1951, exactly 10 years after it was first published. Partly this was because Mills had been missing deadlines: she was a chain-smoker with lung problems, and her dedication to her meticulous artwork took its toll. But partly, argue some commentators, it was because the exploits of a go-getting, self-reliant woman no longer suited the sensibilities of conservative post-war America. Mills survived as a commercial artist, but she never made a comeback in comics. ""Those were difficult times for a woman who wanted to be a cartoonist,"" says Sanapo, ""and Mills needed more support than she got. She was so far ahead\xa0of her time, but she was so underestimated"". She lived her last years as a recluse in a rundown Brooklyn apartment, labouring over an unfinished graphic novel. And when she died in 1988, Miss Fury was all but forgotten – a cruel fate for such an iconic superheroine. ""Honestly, I think it\'s because she\'s not part of a large, well-known universe [like Marvel and DC\'s superheroes],"" says Bechko. ""And also because she kind of gets swamped by Catwoman, who is a very different character even though she sometimes has a similar look."" \nStill, Miss Fury has proven to be a leopard / panther with nine lives. Other writers and artists have revived her: Bechko has written a series of Miss Fury comics for Dynamite Entertainment, and Sanapo has illustrated one. Mills\'s own work has recently been reprinted in lavish hardback collections, with introductions by Trina Robbins, a fellow Brooklyn-born comics innovator. And in 2019 Mills herself was inducted into the American comics industry\'s Eisner Award Hall Of Fame – a mere 13 years after William Moulton Marson, the creator of Wonder Woman, and 23 years after Bob Kane, the co-creator of Batman. To be fair, it\'s unlikely that Miss Fury will ever be as famous as they are, but in some ways she is just as significant. ""There\'s been so much discussion in the last couple of decades about new interpretations of female characters in comics,"" says Madrid, ""and about female creators getting their view out into the world. Tarpé Mills was already doing all that in the 1940s"".\nAnd if you liked this story,\xa0sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called The Essential List.

46,"('multiple', None, None, ['\nThink ""creative genius"" and a parade of self-portraits from the history of art, each brooding intensely before an unfinished canvas, flashes across your mind. You know the ones: from the rumpled nobility of Rembrandt\'s Self-Portrait with Two Circles (1665) to the smouldering introspection of Vincent van Gogh\'s iconic Self-Portrait as a Painter (1886), from the bashful gaze of Francisco Goya\'s Self-Portrait in a Studio (1790) to the circumspect squint of Paul Gauguin\'s Self-Portrait with a Palette (1894). So masculine is the stereotype of the aloof artist, lifting his paintbrush like an existential barbell freighted with psychological weight, it is almost unimaginable that the tradition should have begun with a corseted 20-year-old young woman, whose contribution to cultural history and to shaping our modern idea of the artistic temperament – trapped in a prism of preoccupied thought – has gone largely unappreciated for nearly half a millennium.\nThere is every reason to conclude, as art historians have, that an absorbing self-portrait by a gifted young Flemish Renaissance painter by the name of Caterina van Hemessen, painted in 1548, is likely the first self-portrayal of an artist, male or female, at work at the easel. Such attributions are a risky business, of course. Just ask the endless succession of nominees for inventor of abstract painting (now Kandinsky, now Hilma af Klint, now JMW Turner…). There\'s always a chance that an earlier example, unfairly forgotten by time, will come to light.\nBut in the case of Hemessen\'s transfixing masterpiece, it isn\'t simply the posture – the young woman depicting herself in meta-mid-brushstroke as she sets out to create the very same painting that we see before us – that distinguishes the work as one of the most pioneering in the history of image-making. The depth and complexity of the small, oil-on-oak panel\'s reflection on the very nature of creativity and self-invention is incontestably ground-breaking and changed forever the way artists presented themselves to the world.\n', '\nThough it was customary for portraitists to inscribe their works with captions identifying their sitters, in this instance, the language is anything but clarifying in its function and serves ingeniously to intensify the panel\'s visual verve with a level of semantic, psychological, and philosophical intrigue. Who, after all, is speaking these wafting, weightless words? Are we to imagine that they are being breathed ghostily down the centuries from the departed lips of the artist herself – a gifted stylist who, in an era when few female artists made much headway, so distinguished herself that the queen consort of Hungary and Bohemia, Mary of Austria, retained her services? Or is this declaration, ""I Caterina…"", the ventriloquised whisper from the motionless mouth of the artist\'s alter ego in the painting – a silent semblance of self whose absent eyes stare out assertively but refuse to meet ours? Or does the ""me"" in ""I … painted me"" attach instead to that ever-emerging almost-self on the panel-within-the-panel who is, if we follow the logic of the painting\'s depiction to its conclusion, the eventual, irreducible ""me"" that will ultimately be created? Hemessen\'s portrait presumes the existence of three distinct selves, refracted like a ray of white light in a prism into the bright spectrum of the painter, the painted, and the yet-to-be-painted – a trio locked forever in a spinning phantasmagoria of identity.\nThere can be little doubting that Hemessen deliberately hinged so much of the work\'s intensity on the impenetrable poetry of her riddling inscription. Trained by her father, Jan Sanders van Hemessen, a leading figure of the Romanist School (16th-Century Low Country artists who\'d travelled to Rome) in the Flemish Renaissance, she knew her art history well. The patterning of the language of her floating caption was an unambiguous allusion to what is still, to this day, one of the most arresting self-portraits ever made: Albrecht Dürer\'s Self-Portrait at Twenty-Eight (1500).\n', ""\nThe paintbrush that Hemessen is holding horizontally with her right hand and the vertical maulstick (a painter's prop used to steady an artist's arm) that leans upright against the panel, nudged in place by her palette-gripped left hand, are carefully positioned to form an unmistakable cross. Against the fledgling self-portrait that she has started to describe on the white panel, this superimposed cross becomes an insinuated crucifix thrust upon the emerging image of the artist. Hemessen appears to be asserting that her vision and her craft at once redeem and torture her – a sentiment that would have far-reaching implications for how future generations of artists perceived their own condition.\nThe intriguing sense of artistic and spiritual mirroring activated by the self-portrait – of Hemessen merging her identity now with Dürer, now with Christ – is magnified by a mystery of actual optical mirroring that hangs over any perception of this perplexing painting. To appreciate any self-portrait is to presume the existence of a looking glass used by the artist and positioned somewhere outside the painting's frame – a materially reflective surface that makes possible the image the painter is creating.\n"", '\nBut in Hemessen\'s reflection, something doesn\'t add up. In the painting we have before us, the artist\'s head is in the top right of the panel, whereas in the panel on the easel, the painting within the painting, the fragment head is in the top left. It is as if Hemessen has cleverly corrected the optical inversion of the image of herself that the mirror she is looking into, outside the frame, has created. As a result, it is the barely begun and fragmentary self-portrait-within-the-self-portrait that is truer to life than the finished painting we see before us.\nBy playfully entangling herself (and us) in a mind-bending puzzle of mirrors, Hemessen has created more than a rollicking retinal riddle. She has produced a profound visual treatise on the very nature and substance of spiritual and physical imitation – a topic at the centre of contemporary religious thought. A century before Hemessen painted her self-portrait, the late Medieval Dutch-German theologian Thomas à Kempis published his influential Christian devotional book The Imitation of Christ, a guide to spiritual life that seizes upon the prop of the mirror to emphasise the importance of reflecting the holiness of the universe. ""If your heart were right,"" à Kempis writes in the book\'s fourth chapter, ""then every created thing would be a mirror of life for you and a book of holy teaching, for there is no creature so small and worthless that it does not show forth the goodness of God."" A mirror is never just a mirror. In Hemessen\'s day, it was a crucible of virtue, a sounding board of salvation.\n', '\nAmplifying the significance of the mirror in the imagination of the time, and of even deeper resonance to Hemessen\'s work, are the writings of the 14th-Century Italian mystic, St Catherine of Siena, whose teachings had been in popular circulation in Europe since the beginning of the 16th Century. As if presciently sanctioning the visual verve of Hemessen\'s painting, in which the artist dares to see herself not merely performing a function typically assigned to men (painting), but assuming aspects of the male Christ, Catherine of Siena challenged the notion that women were not equally summoned to see themselves as mirrors of Christ. Marshalling the metaphor of the looking glass, she asserts that Christ is ""a mirrour that needis I moste biholde, in the which myrrour is representid to me that I am thin ymage & creature"".\nCaught in a crossfire of ricocheting reflections – religious and feminist, optical and artistic – \xa0Hemessen\'s inexhaustible panel deserves credit for tracing the cultural and psychological axes against which all subsequent self-portraiture will plot itself. Her underappreciated painting in many ways establishes the themes that far-better-known self-portraits from Rembrandt to Cindy Sherman, Artemisia Gentileschi to Picasso, would explore in the ensuing centuries, works that have come to define not merely the respective oeuvres of those exceptional artists, but the story of art itself in the last half millennium. What keeps our eyes transfixed on those masterpieces by Van Gogh and Frida Kahlo is the poignancy of their comprehension, their hope, that perhaps some element of ourselves can survive the fleeting dabs and strokes of our moments in time, can survive as an energy that echoes across ages – an instinct that Caterina van Hemessen gave deft voice to in the confounding physics of her mysterious masterpiece.\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our\xa0Facebook\xa0page or message us on\xa0Twitter.\nAnd if you liked this story,\xa0sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called The Essential List.

47,"('multiple', None, None, [""\nIt's hard to overstate Ruth E Carter's achievement in costume design on Black Panther, even now, three years after the film's release. She did, after all, win an Oscar for it. Not only did a massive movie franchise like Marvel finally put a leading black superhero on screen, but he was regally dressed too. As many pundits noted, the film marked a defining moment for black America. But it was a moment that also reverberated throughout the world, not least on the African continent itself, where the Basotho blankets and Ndebele neck-rings were instantly recognised for the items of rich heritage they are.\xa0It was a moment of pride that for so long had been denied to Africans portrayed on screen in Hollywood productions.\nTen of those Black Panther costumes\xa0– plus some from Coming 2 America\xa0– are included in an exhibition dedicated to Carter's career at Atlanta's Scad Fash Museum of Fashion + Film. The exhibition,\xa0titled Afrofuturism in Costume Design,\xa0is running until mid-September, and tells the story of the 60-year-old's ascension as one of only two costume designers in history – and the first black woman – to have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It's also the story of how Carter has played a groundbreaking role in the way African fashion is seen.\n"", '\nWorking together with Oscar-winning production designer Hannah Beachler, Carter borrowed from indigenous people across the continent, like the Tuareg of the Sahara and the Himba of Namibia, and also built a palette out of the Pan-African flag colours, using black, red and green across the main cast\'s costumes.\nBy the time she worked on Black Panther, Carter already had dozens of films to her credit, and was Oscar-nominated for Amistad and Malcolm X, and Emmy-nominated for Roots in 2016. As the exhibition shows, Carter\'s path as a costume designer has been cemented by her ability to bring different facets of black experiences to the big screen. The underlying theme of the exhibition – and to a great extent, her career is, she says: ""How do we show that slaves had an idea of their own Afrofuture? How did they visualise their Afrofuture? How did you show that with Amistad? With Selma? How do you show that culture lives and breathes no matter what your circumstances are, that we\'re always aspirational?""\n', '\nBlack Panther allowed Carter to ""connect everything I\'ve done about slavery and about how Africans came to this country, and what happened to their culture,"" she says.\nAfrican filmmakers, from the early works of Senegal\'s Ousmane Sembène to the breakout stars of Nigeria\'s popular Nollywood titles, have long used film and TV to tell their stories, and to reflect back particular styles and sensibilities of their culture. Many classics remain influential today, in the way that Jay Z and Beyoncé\'s On The Run II tour poster was inspired by Djibril Diop Mambéty’s 1973 film Touki Bouki, or Vogue writes about the enduring, if tragic, sophistication of Sembéne’s\xa01966 film La Noire de. Netflix, too, is streaming more content produced in Africa these days, feeding an appetite for homegrown movies and TV shows that go deeper than the Hollywood stereotypes typically have.\nAfrica doesn\'t need Hollywood, but thanks to the work of costume designers like Carter\xa0– along with the rise of social media, particularly Instagram – we\'ve begun to enjoy a far richer experience of the continent\'s fashion on screens beyond its borders. While Hollywood has been playing catch-up in decolonising the gaze that has for so long informed its productions – buoyed by a leftover legacy of Western filmmakers depicting Africans as exotic and wild, in decades-old tales like Out of Africa and The African Queen – the depiction of its fashion has progressed. Less animal print and \'curio\' items, more accurate reflections of individuals with agency.\n', '\nBlack Panther was not the first time a costume designer for a major studio production relied on real African influences to portray a fictional African country. In 1989, in the first Coming to America, Deborah Nadoolman Landis looked to the late Emperor of Ethiopia, Haile Selassie, for the outfits of King Jaffe Joffer (James Earl Jones) and to Senegal for the kaftan that Queen Aoleon (Madge Sinclair) wore in Zamunda. Nadoolman, who scored an Oscar for the costumes, had been an avid lover of African arts and textiles, long before the Coming to America screenplay was written.\nWhile the storyline itself may still have a way to go in its reliance on old tropes, Carter, as costume designer for the sequel, elevated Coming 2 America by tapping actual designers working in Africa to assist creating the film\'s 800 costumes. Expanding what she started doing on Black Panther, she helped expose local fashion designers to a wider audience, and also showcased their individual triumphs. In the patterned knitted vest that Eddie Murphy\'s Prince Akeem wears in a scene with his newfound son is the 10-year success story of South African designer Laduma Ngxokolo\'s Maxhosa. In the dresses that Prince Akeem\'s daughters wear is the fashion empire that Palesa Mokubung – the first African designer to collaborate with H&M, in 2019 – has built.\n""Their collections mean so much more to them than just fashion,"" says Carter. ""Their collections represent their childhood and their pride in being South African."" Indeed, Ngxokolo\'s creations come from a desire to update clothing for the initiation ceremony of his Xhosa upbringing. Ghanaian designer Mimi Plange, too, draws on Nuba painting and scarification in her work, like the hand-painted leather skater dress that Kiki Layne wears in Coming 2 America. The details contribute to giving film-goers a more expansive view of Africa, and not stuck in time either.\n', '\n""There have been generations of images of Africa that weren\'t positive,"" says Dawodu. ""In some ways, American culture and Western culture is steeped in the idea of presenting Africa as inferior. It\'s not even just in one movie where you saw that.""\nHe credits Black Panther with raising the consciousness of the world about Africa but says music has played an even bigger part. Of course, another Carter has been instrumental – Beyoncé Knowles Carter. Through Black is King and her Black Parade guide to black-owned businesses, the Grammy-winning star has showcased many African labels. Ivorians Lafalaise Dion and Loza Maléombho and Senegal\'s Tongoro Studio by Sarah Diouf and Adama Paris are among the prominent designers who were headhunted by her longtime stylist, Zerina Akers.\xa0\nFor her Spirit video, Beyoncé wore a monochromatic outfit featuring a black-and-white suit complete with a durag, facepiece and earrings by Tongoro, a brand she also sported at the Global Citizen Concert in South Africa in 2018. At that event, the singer also showed off a ""metamorphosis dress"" by South African duo Quiteria and George along with an ancient Egyptian beaded bodysuit by Enhle Mbali Maphumulo.\nBut even before Beyoncé\'s various African showcases, her sister Solange celebrated Cape Town\'s sapeurs – a Congolese subculture that has its own established chapter in South Africa – in the 2012 video for Losing You.\n', '\nAnd before Cameroonian designer Claude Kameni\'s label Lavie by CK appeared in Coming 2 America, in the form of Mirembe\'s wedding dress, the West African-textile-inspired line was being worn by stars like Tracee Ellis Ross (while hosting the 2018 American Music Awards) and Viola Davis (on a Vanity Fair cover). Similarly, before Ozwald Boateng\'s teal single-button suit with lip plate wowed in Black Panther, the British-Ghanaian had carved out a space as the youngest designer on London\'s Saville Row.\nBut Black Panther coalesced a lot of the moments that came before it. It gave Boateng, for example, the chance to embrace his African heritage, in a way he hadn\'t before, as Carter explained to Vulture. ""Usually we see this lip plate in National Geographic on women with no tops who are sitting on the ground, and here is [a man] with his legs crossed and a beautiful suit by the fashion designer Ozwald Boateng. He is bringing so much pride and so much honour to it.""\nAbove pride, above honour, it\'s about imagination, believes Awam Amkpa, NYU interim dean of arts and humanities, and professor of drama, social and cultural analysis. ""What we\'re seeing affirms Africa is more than a place; Africa as spaces of affect,"" he tells BBC Culture. ""And as spaces of affect, they can generate utopias, and that\'s what Africans give to themselves to survive the complex and sometimes derogatory history of the continent.""\n', '\nHe says this is true for Africans in the diaspora and those coming from a similar background too, and becomes even more so when juxtaposing a film like Black Panther against the Black Lives Matter movement. ""For a people for whom temporality is a space of violence, they\'ve got to imagine other spaces where they can be subjects rather than objects,"" he says. ""That desire for invention, for those utopias, is also another way of resistant living in an America that continues to negate people and their communities."" Fashion is a way to rewrite the script.\nAs Carter begins work on the Black Panther sequel, and London\'s Victoria & Albert Museum starts curating a 2022 African fashion exhibition, there will be more to come. ""The first Black Panther was an experience we\'ll never repeat again,"" says Carter. ""The new one will be a continuation and a broadening of the story.""\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our\xa0Facebook\xa0page or message us on\xa0Twitter.\nAnd if you liked this story,\xa0sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called The Essential List.

Reports suggest he is currently under house arrest.\nA Jordanian military official, however, said Prince Hamzah, 41, was only ordered to halt activities “aimed at undermining the security and stability of Jordan”.\nJordan’s ruling family traces its lineage back to Islam’s Prophet Muhammad. Prince Hamzah was born on March 29, 1980, in the capital Amman. He is the half-brother of King Abdullah II.\nWhen their father King Al Hussein bin Talal passed away from cancer in 1999, Abdullah, 59, was crowned and Hamza was titled the crown prince of Jordan.\nThe designation was out of respect for King Hussein, who ruled for nearly 50 years and was known to have favoured Hamza the most among his 11 children from four marriages.\nHowever, King Abdullah stripped him of this title five years later and gave it to his own eldest son Al Hussein bin Abdullah II, 26.\nKing Abdullah said he had decided to “free” Prince Hamzah “from the constraints of the position of crown prince in order to give you the freedom to work and undertake any mission or responsibility I entrust you with”.\nBut the decision was seen as a move by King Abdullah to consolidate his power.\nSpeaking in English in a video passed by his lawyer to the BBC, Prince Hamzah said he was not part of any conspiracy and denounced the ruling system as corrupt.\n“[Jordanians’] wellbeing has been put second by a ruling system that has decided that its personal interests, financial interests, that its corruption is more important than the lives and dignity and future of the 10 million people who live here,” he said.\nAbdullah and Hamzah have not displayed any open rivalry over the years. In the videotaped statement, a portrait of King Hussein could be seen on the wall behind the prince, who currently holds no official position.\nHamzah is a popular figure in Jordan. He is seen as religious and modest, in touch with the common people and similar to his beloved father, the late King Hussein. He has criticised the government in the past, accusing officials of “failed management” after they approved an income tax law in 2018.\nPrince Hamzah is not seen as a big threat to Jordan’s monarchy and has been marginalised for years, but the move against him represents the first such incident involving a close member of the royal family since King Abdullah came to the throne.\nThe authorities have become increasingly concerned with his efforts to build ties with disgruntled figures within powerful Jordanian tribes.\nThese people, known as the Herak, have in recent weeks called for protests against corruption in a country hit hard by the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, pushing unemployment to record levels and deepening poverty. The authorities had cracked down on several demonstrations, detaining dozens.\nTribes that dominate the security forces form the bedrock of support for the kingdom’s Hashemite monarchy.\nPrince Hamzah is often photographed meeting with tribal figures and is known to be popular, especially among tribal and East Bank Jordanians, for his uncanny resemblance to his father, who was beloved by many in the kingdom.\nHis recent meetings with tribal leaders across Jordan and posts on Twitter in 2018 that included the rousing words, “Oh my country”, caused a stir in the kingdom. His visits to tribal elders at their invitation were broadly viewed as his way of showing his relevance and closeness to people.\n'])",politics,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/4/profile-who-is-jordans-prince-hamza

But the law says he must.\n“Benjamin Netanyahu has a slightly higher chance of forming a government. I have decided to entrust him with the task of doing so.”\nIt was short of a full-throated endorsement. The charges facing Israel’s longest-serving prime minister presented the president with an extraordinary choice whether “morality” should be a factor in who should lead the government.\nThe March 23 election revolved around whether Netanyahu is fit to continue serving. His Likud party won the most seats, but no party won a governing majority of 61 seats in the Knesset. That handed Rivlin the task of deciding who has the best chance of cobbling together a coalition.\nNetanyahu denies all charges and says prosecutors are trying to undermine the voters intent and overthrow him.\nIn the 120-member Knesset, centrist politician and ex-finance minister Yair Lapid of the Yesh Atid party garnered 45 endorsements and former defence minister Naftali Bennett of the far-right Yamina party got seven.\nThree parties, with a total of 16 parliamentary seats, declined in their meetings with Rivlin to nominate a candidate.\nNetanyahu has urged Bennett and another former ally, Gideon Saar, who founded the right-wing New Horizon party after leaving the prime minister’s conservative Likud, to join him to break the deadlock.\nBennett has been non-committal about teaming up again with Netanyahu, with whom he has had a rocky relationship.\nSaar has said he would not serve under Netanyahu, citing the prime minister’s corruption trial – which opened on Monday – but stopped short of endorsing Lapid.\nNetanyahu, who has denied any criminal wrongdoing, attended part of the court session and later repeated accusations that the prosecution’s case was “an attempted coup” aimed at overthrowing a “strong, right-wing prime minister”.\nLapid said on Monday he proposed a coalition deal to Bennett. Under the arrangement, Bennett would serve first as prime minister and then Lapid would take over.\n“The Israeli public needs to see that its leaders can work together,” Lapid said in a televised address.\nBennett made no immediate comment about Lapid’s offer. Political commentators said such a deal might also pave the way for right-winger Saar to join Lapid, with the prospect of Bennett, a fellow conservative, at the helm.\nNetanyahu will have 28 days to try to put together a coalition and can request a two-week extension from Rivlin, who has the option of assigning the task to someone else if no government is formed.\nThe crossing was completely sealed off in March last year to control the spread of coronavirus.\nSaudi Arabia’s foreign minister says such a move depends on progress of peace process.\nPrime minister appears in court at his corruption trial as President Rivlin begins talks on who should lead the gov’t.\n'])",politics,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/6/israels-president-to-announce-candidate-to-form-new-government

That’s a very small part of what they’re calling an infrastructure package,” he said.\nBiden on Wednesday unveiled the broad infrastructure spending package, which includes funding for everything from roads and bridges to broadband and elderly care, along with higher corporate taxes.\n“Independent analysis shows that if we pass this plan the economy will create 19 million jobs,” Biden told reporters on Friday, according to Bloomberg. “Good jobs, blue-collar jobs, jobs that pay well.”\nBut the proposal drew immediate backlash from Republicans, who favour less government spending overall.\nRepublican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said last week that if the plan would lead to “massive tax increases and trillions more added to the national debt”, then it was unlikely to receive the party’s support.\nThe infrastructure proposal is the second massive government spending package introduced since Biden took office in January, after his $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill narrowly passed in Congress and was signed into law in March.\nThat bill also had faced opposition from Republicans, who criticised its high price tag.\nButtigieg said he hopes Republicans would come around to the proposal.\n“This is one area where the American people absolutely want to see us get it done, where members on both sides of the aisle have been talking about getting it done for a long time,” he said.\n“I think this is something that everybody can get behind, and we’re going to keep working to try to earn that support across the aisle.”\nThere are times when Americans are concerned with the national debt.

51,"('multiple', None, None, ['\nDaily infection rates reached a record high days before Sunday’s vote, in which two new populist formations will participate.\nSofia, Bulgaria – With days until Sunday’s parliamentary elections, Bulgaria on Wednesday registered 5,176 daily COVID-19 cases – a record since the start of the pandemic.\nDespite high infection rates and a strained healthcare system, the Bulgarian government has decided to go forward with the vote.\nBut with a growing number of people in hospital and home quarantine, questions have emerged about how they will be able to vote.\nThe government has tasked the municipalities with organising mobile polling stations to accommodate these voters. Local authorities have said, however, that very few people have sent the required forms to request this option and therefore, few mobile polling stations will be made available.\nAs a result, many of the 120,000 people under quarantine and the nearly 10,000 in hospital may be unable to cast their vote.\nThe nearly one million Bulgarians living abroad with the right to vote will also likely be affected due to lockdown measures in the countries they live in and the absence of an option to vote by mail or electronically.\nFear of getting infected will also discourage some voters from turning up at the polling stations.\nAccording to observers, these factors could significantly lower the turnout.\n“A normal turnout at parliamentary elections, if we look at the data from the past few years, is around 42-43 percent. I won’t be surprised if [this year] it is under 40 percent [or] as low as 35 percent,” said Petar Cholakov, associate professor of sociology at the Institute for the Study of Societies and Knowledge at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences.\nPrime Minister Boyko Borissov’s centre-right GERB party is leading polls, with a projected 27-30 percent of the vote.\nHowever, analysts say low turnout, vote fragmentation and partisan politics may make the formation of a new government quite difficult.\nAmid warnings from health officials that the healthcare system was “on the verge of collapse”, the Bulgarian government imposed a 10-day lockdown in March to try to control the spread of the virus. Ahead of the elections, high infection rates, however, have persisted.\nEven so, earlier this week, the government eased lockdown measures, allowing restaurants, cafes, gyms, spas, galleries, cinemas, museums and other public spaces to reopen with some capacity restrictions on April 1.\nBut according to Cholakov, the criticism GERB has faced over its handling of the COVID-19 response will not necessarily affect its electoral performance.\nIn fact, the pandemic may work in its favour, as lower turnout would allow parties with a core electorate and younger supporters – like GERB and the Movement for Rights and Liberties (MRL), which is traditionally supported by the Turkish minority – to perform better, Cholakov said.\nGovernment officials have tried to reassure the public, with Minister of Health Kostadin Angelov insisting that “all measures to ensure a safe election” have been taken.\nBut the opposition has criticised governing coalition’s policies and warned of “chaos in the electoral process” due to the way machine voting was introduced.\nThis election will be the first in which Bulgarians will have the option to vote through a paper ballot or a voting machine. Critics say the way the electoral process is now set up makes vote counting unnecessarily complicated and may lead to delays in the announcement of results.\nThe Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), which currently is polling second with about 23 percent, may see a significant loss of votes, as its older voter base may be reluctant to go to the polls.\nWhile GERB is able to maintain its electoral lead, its junior partners, the far-right VMRO, Ataka and NFSB, are polling around or below the four-percent threshold for entering parliament.\nAccording to Jana Tsoneva, a Sofia-based sociologist, the far right’s participation in GERB’s coalition government has eroded its support in the electorate.\nHowever, far-right ideas continue to influence the political scene in Bulgaria, pulling all other parties to the right and pushing foreign and domestic policies in a more nationalistic and conservative direction, she said.\nThis has affected relations with neighbouring countries, especially North Macedonia.\n“The Bulgarian government’s entire foreign policy [towards North Macedonia] has become a hostage to the Macedonian obsessions of a far-right junior coalition partner,” Tsoneva said.\nIn November 2020, Bulgaria blocked North Macedonia’s accession negotiations with the European Union, drawing the ire of the Macedonian government and public.\nVMRO has made the “Macedonian question” a central part of its electoral platform.\nEarlier this week, the deputy head of VMRO Angel Dzhambazki released an election campaign video in which he suggested North Macedonia is Bulgarian territory, which provoked a sharp reaction in Skopje.\nThe far-right’s loss of electoral support has coincided with the rise of two new populist formations – There Are Such People, led by popular talk show host Slavi Trifonov, which is polling at 11-14 percent and Stand Up! Thugs Out! headed by Maya Manolova, former ombudswoman and BSP member, which is polling at 5-6 percent.\nAccording to Sofia-based analyst Asen Genov, the rise of these new parties reflects the tendency of part of the Bulgarian electorate to seek out political “saviours”. They have gained popularity despite their lack of a clear political platform.\n“[Bulgarian voters] are always waiting for the next saviour. We had this with the tsar, then we had it with Borisov,” Genov said, referring to Tsar Simeon II, the son of Bulgaria’s last monarch before the communist era, who became prime minister in 2001. “The naïve Bulgarian voters will now vote for a new messiah.”\nThe entry of the new populist parties and a highly fragmented vote may complicate government formation after the elections.\nThere Are Such People, Stand Up! Thugs Out! and the centre-right Democratic Bulgaria have said that they will not join a GERB-led coalition after supporting last year’s anti-government protests. BSP has also traditionally refused to consider a partnership with GERB.\n“If all parties that make it into parliament keep their campaign promises not to enter into coalition with certain political forces, then we won’t have a government after these elections. This means we’ll have early elections,” Genov said, adding that they may be scheduled for the same date with the presidential vote due in November.\nExcept for ruling out a coalition with BSP, GERB has remained open to partnering with others.\nAccording to Cholakov, even if the composition of the next parliament is highly fragmented, there is still a chance that Borissov will pull off a new government, which would be his fourth since 2009.\n“Borissov is a master of the divide-and-rule approach, which will likely be deployed in the next parliament to cannibalise Triffonov’s There Are Such People [in GERB’s favour],” he said.\nCholakov also pointed out that the persistent fragmentation of the opposition, the lack of party discipline and cohesion continue to play into Borissov’s hands, who remains in power, despite decreasing support for his party.\n'])",politics,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/2/fears-of-low-turnout-as-bulgaria-prepares-to-vote-in-pandemic

It’s quite a statement to build something like this in such a remote part of the Roman Empire.”\nBetween the global COVID-19 pandemic and numerous internal crises, Lebanon’s economy – already largely dependent on new US dollars brought in by remittances, international tourists and foreign investors – has suffered greatly.\nRather than replace real-world tourism, Baalbek Reborn: Temples is intended to raise awareness around the world of this unique world heritage site and encourage more tourism to Lebanon in general.\nThe project used computer-aided design software such as AutoCAD and 3D Studio Max for 3D modelling, combing them with blueprint drawings provided by the DAI, along with 8K resolution panoramic photography from the ground and drone footage from above. Flyover Zone’s team then use a programme called Unity to integrate all these elements into their virtual simulation.\nFor Flyover Zone’s founder and president, Bernard Frischer, this project has been a dream come true. Within hours of its launch, the virtual tour had already surpassed 10,000 downloads.\n“My day job still is that I’m a professor of informatics, and my branch of informatics is computing applied to cultural heritage,” he explained. “We started this company a few years ago to create virtual reconstructions of the most important cultural heritage sites around the world [using] 3D digital technology to visualize the latest scientific results, making it possible for the general public to take virtual trips through space and time.”\nWithin the app, users will be able to explore a series of 38 fully interactive, 360-degree panoramas, allowing them to investigate whatever might happen to catch their eye.\nAt the press of a button, a virtual tablet provided as part of the tour will provide text descriptions of locations, additional images, and an audio slider that controls the playback of a full audio-commentary soundtrack, produced in tandem with experts from the DAI and available in Arabic, English, French and German.\n“The representation you can see will be tailored to the content of the commentary,” explained Burwitz. “If we explain the site today, you will see it as it looks today but if we talk about what it looked like in 215, the image will switch automatically to take you on a time travel to the year 215 and to show you what it looked like in antiquity.”\nFrischer said there is “no point in doing this sort of reconstruction if it’s fanciful or artistic”.\n“Yes, it should look beautiful and artistic in that sense, but if it’s only fanciful then it has no value, at least for academic purposes. The only way to make the model have value is to collaborate with the world’s experts who’ve been working on these monuments and really know all the details of what they looked like. So for Baalbek that would be the DAI, and thank God they agreed to help us.”\nSome sites, such as the Temple of Bacchus, have been remarkably well-preserved and are still standing today. Others have almost completely disappeared, leaving behind only scant but nonetheless impressive remains, such as the six remaining rose granite columns – each more than 20 metres (66 feet) high and about 2 metres (6.5 feet) in diameter – that once framed the now absent Temple of Jupiter.\n“Our part was to make sure the correct scientific bases were chosen,” said Burwitz. “We can see in the reconstruction the full extent of this marvellous building.

In the US, millions of Americans lost their jobs and many small businesses were forced to close permanently. Women, people of colour and low-wage workers are still feeling the most economic pain in the pandemic-induced crisis.\n“We’re in a deep hole,” Yellen said Monday, adding that the true US unemployment rate is close to 9 percent – versus the March rate of 6 percent showed in Bureau of Labor Statistics data that didn’t include people who have given up looking for work.\nThe Biden administration is set on returning to a strong system of multilateralism, engaging in global markets and protecting and enforcing a rules-based system. A stable world economy that fights poverty and promotes inclusion benefits the US.\nBut too many middle- and low-income countries lack the financing to support their economies and are constrained in their abilities to buy coronavirus vaccines.\nYellen warned that this could lead to entrenched poverty and inequality that reverses decades of progress. Low-income countries risk falling behind and may not access the vaccines they need at least until 2023, and, in some cases, 2024, she said Monday.\n“We need to help lessen the economic pain in low-income countries,” Yellen stressed, commending the IMF’s plan to expand special drawing rights (SDRs) — a sort of artificial currency that can be traded in for hard currency —\xa0 by $650bn to give developing countries the liquidity they need to buy vaccines and keep economies afloat.\nBut opponents of the proposed global minimum tax rate say it won’t help low-income countries that would benefit from corporations doing business there.\n“I think having the global minimum tax would be unfair to poor countries,” Edwards of the Cato Institute said. “It infringes on all of our sovereignty.”\nWe gather the numbers to know from the week’s biggest economic news stories so you can impress your friends.\nFunds will go to installing charging stations as well as tax credits for consumers to buy American-made electric cars.\nSenator John Kennedy said the extra cash influx would direct money from US taxpayers to China, Russia and Venezuela.\nTwo economic titans said that for change on a macro level, women must be welcomed and respected in economics.\n'])",business,https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/4/5/race-to-the-bottom-yellen-makes-case-for-global-minimum-tax-rate

They were furious about not conducting the elections. I told them I will provide a roadmap and we should discuss it in a civilised manner.”\nA PFF spokesperson added that “staff was physically harassed and held hostage”.\nShah was named PFF president after a 2018 election held on the instructions of the country’s Supreme Court.\nFIFA, football’s world governing body, and the Asian Football Confederation refused to recognise him as the elected president, ruling the court’s move a “third-party interference” in running of the national football body.\nIn 2019, FIFA installed the NC – initially chaired by Humza Khan – to strengthen the football structure in Pakistan, aiming to achieve a functioning administration by conducting transparent elections.\nAfter Khan’s resignation in December 2020, FIFA named Malik as the body’s chair.\nTensions have been brewing over the past months between the group led by Shah and the NC over what they see as a delay in holding elections.\nIn 2015, Pakistan was banned by FIFA due to third-party interference and there is fear among football circles that Saturday’s events might lead to another suspension.\nMalik said he suspects the officials who took part in the “attack” will be banned and “FIFA will probably declare them as ‘persona non-grata'”.\n“FIFA takes these matters strongly and will likely ban Pakistan which means we won’t have functional football for five years. This will just kill football in the country,” added Malik.\nThe incident also forced the cancellation of the ongoing women’s football championship that kicked off earlier this month in the southern coastal city of Karachi.\nWith 19 teams comprising young female footballers coming from all over the country to take part in the event, the cancellation left participants shocked and disappointed.\n“It is a dark day for all women football players in the country.

There are no facilities in our village – no piped water, no proper toilets, nothing,” said Majgul.\nNear his home, children with tangled, unwashed hair ran barefoot across narrow alleys lined with shanties.\nHope came in the form of a scheme launched in 1987 by a government eager to boost the country’s dismal Summer Olympics tally, with Indian athletes taking just nine gold medals in the last century.\n“We were exploring whether the Siddis had a genetic advantage,” athletics coach R Sundar Raju, who was part of the project, told AFP.\n“Normally an Indian athlete takes some years before making it to the national level, but the Siddis were doing so in barely three years.”\nBut authorities ditched the project seven years later, after realising the impoverished Siddi were more interested in a linked programme that encouraged Indians to pursue sporting careers by giving them highly sought-after government jobs.\n“They came from such poor families that the moment they secured jobs under a sports quota, they grabbed the opportunity and left the training midway,” Raju said.\nIn the years since, some Siddis in Gujarat instead eked out a living by staging dance performances for tourists or trained as forest guides for Gir National Park, a sanctuary for endangered lions.\nThe state government revived the programme in 2015, focusing mainly on judo and athletics. Promising Siddi youngsters now train at a state-run sports academy.\nA non-profit group in Karnataka is also mentoring 50 aspiring athletes from the community.\n“We felt that this particular group has high potential but has been highly neglected,” said Nitish Chiniwar, founder of the Bridges of Sports Foundation.\nShahnaz Lobi, an aspiring shot-putter from Jambur, jumped at the chance to pursue a sporting career after watching her labourer father struggle to feed his family.\n“I used to curse my fate. But one day I got to know about the sports trials and I took part in them,” she said.\nLobi told AFP that she dreamed of competing in the 2024 Olympics.\n“I was selected and sent to the state sports academy. I have no friends there but it doesn’t bother me. I just want to win an Olympic medal and let the world know I am Indian.”\n‘The law of mobs is always there,’ says one student, describing racist attacks on Africans in Greater Noida.\n‘I speak Hindi and always laugh.

When players start up the game, they will be able to create a character that has a masculine or feminine voice no matter what their body looks like, according to people familiar with the game’s development. The people requested anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak to the press.\nPlayers will then get to select one of two options — “witch” or “wizard” — that will determine the dorm they get placed in at the magical school of Hogwarts and how they are addressed by other characters in the game.\nAlthough this level of customization has grown more common in video games and is no longer unusual, it’s noteworthy for Hogwarts Legacy.

I apologise for the hurt my visit caused and have taken down the video. It was a mistake and I accept that.” \nThe LGBT+ Labour group said it was pleased Starmer had “recognised and apologised for this mistake”. It added: “We look forward to working with you to end conversion therapy and achieve equality for LGBT+ people.”\nThank you @KeirStarmer. We are pleased that you have recognised and apologised for this mistake. We look forward to working with you to end conversion therapy and achieve equality for LGBT+ people. https://t.co/kG1gkYS1vY\nEarlier on Monday, the group had spoken of the hurt caused by the visit by Starmer and the local Labour MP Dawn Butler.\n“We immediately contacted the leader of the opposition’s office to inform them that their visit was unacceptable. We reiterated how important it is that the party stands shoulder-to-shoulder with the LGBT+ community, as it has so often done in its history, and that the visit had caused considerable damage to that aim,” the group said.\n“More importantly, we told the leader of the opposition that the community was extremely hurt by their actions. We also conveyed that the LGBT+ community’s trust in the party was already in question, given their lack of action over transphobia in the party – including from some of its own elected representatives – and that incidents like this were adding to that problem.”\nThe group said it had accepted the explanation from Starmer’s office that the necessary research had not been carried out ahead of the visit. But they criticised Starmer for not immediately issuing a public apology and said members of the shadow cabinet had sought to justify the visit instead.\nThe Labour leader is not the only public figure to have faced criticism for visiting Jesus House.

73,"('multiple', None, None, ['\nCarbon emissions from England’s planned £27bn roadbuilding programme will be about 100 times greater than the government has stated, according to expert witnesses in a court challenge.\nEnvironmental campaigners are seeking a judicial review of the second roads investment strategy (RIS2), which was described by ministers when launched as “the largest ever investment in English strategic roads”, paying for 4,000 miles of road and including such schemes as the Lower Thames Crossing and the Stonehenge tunnel.\nLawyers for Transport Action Network (TAN) claim that the strategy is incompatible with climate crisis commitments. Government lawyers have argued that the additional net greenhouse gases from the roadbuilding are de minimis, or too small to be material.\nHowever, testimony from two UK transport and environment professors – both of whom have previously acted as advisers to the government – said the true impact of the roadbuilding would be many times greater than the Department for Transport’s calculations suggest.\nMinisters and DfT officials have stated that new schemes in RIS2 would contribute just 0.27 megatonnes of CO2 equivalent (MtCO2e) until 2032, the end of the UK’s fifth carbon budget period, under the framework set out by the Committee on Climate Change.\nThe transport minister, Rachel Maclean, told the Green party MP Caroline Lucas in a parliamentary answer: “When compared to the UK’s fifth carbon budget of 1,725 MtCO2e, these schemes represent an extremely small component.”\nHowever, the two expert witnesses testified to the high court that the official calculations dramatically underestimate the figures – potentially by a factor of 100 or more.\nPhil Goodwin, emeritus professor of transport policy at UCL, said in a deposition that “the total emissions of carbon from RIS2 schemes reported by Highways England in its separate scheme appraisals give a number which is roundly 100 times greater than that suggested by DfT witnesses”.\nHe said that the government’s calculations appeared to include only “new” schemes in RIS2, amounting to just five of the 50 listed in the £27bn roadbuilding programme. He said it appeared to exclude significant contributors to the climate crisis such as emissions from construction, and that the government had not factored in a lifetime impact, but made forecasts only until 2032 – when some of the road schemes would not have been completed.\nJillian Anable, professor of transport and energy at the University of Leeds, testified: “We are not aware of any calculation by the DfT of a cumulative figure for carbon emissions through to 2050, arising from all the road schemes funded by the RIS2 … and covering construction emissions as well as ongoing increases in emissions due to higher vehicle speeds and induced traffic.\n“This is the relevant figure in order to understand the impact of RIS2.”\nIt is understood that the government believes construction climate costs are accounted for elsewhere, under the emissions trading scheme. The DfT also argues that its forthcoming decarbonisation plan, and especially the transition to electric vehicles, will vastly reduce emissions.\nDfT lawyers had attempted to rule the expert witness statements inadmissible but judges at a pre-trial hearing in March ruled that their evidence regarding emissions should be heard.\nA high court hearing is expected in the summer.\nA DfT spokesperson said: “We do not comment on ongoing legal proceedings.”\nChris Todd, the director of TAN said: “Even when all cars are electric, building ever bigger roads and ever more cars means adding carbon emissions from construction, manufacturing and maintenance, extra emissions the planet can’t afford.“Simply focusing on tailpipe emissions risks shifting many emissions from one sector to another. Ministers should stop refusing to do the maths and add up all the climate impacts of their policies. It’s time for roadbuilding to face its final reckoning.”\nLucas, the Green party MP, said: “Ministers need to start doing some serious maths on their climate action. This analysis shows the roadbuilding programme will not only swallow vast sums of public money, it is also even more damaging to the climate than the government claimed.\n“What very little progress the government was making on the climate emergency, like the green homes grant scheme, is being abandoned while it is pressing ahead with plans which will take us backwards. Whatever climate reputation the UK had is being shredded by this government. At this rate Boris Johnson will be turning up the Cop26 climate summit [in Glasgow in November] with nothing to offer but empty pledges and fiddled figures.” \nThe challenge to RIS2 is running in parallel to another crowdfunded action by TAN, seeking judicial review of the national policy statement on roadbuilding. Court documents from that case indicate that Grant Shapps went against official advice that the policy should be reviewed, the Guardian revealed earlier this year.\n'])",politics,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/apr/06/co2-from-englands-road-plan-up-to-100-times-more-than-dft-says
74,"('multiple', None, None, [""\nLong Covid patients have voiced growing frustration at a “postcode lottery” in clinical support for debilitating symptoms, with some areas of the UK offering no specialist clinics more than a year after coronavirus took hold.\nOther sufferers said they were disappointed by long Covid clinics investigating certain symptoms only, with no comprehensive treatment plan.\nOfficial figures suggest there are almost 700,000 Britons with Covid symptoms lasting over three months. In October, NHS England announced more than £10m for a network of clinics bringing together doctors, nurses, therapists and other NHS staff to conduct physical and psychological assessments and recommend treatments for long Covid patients.\nAdditional local funding would also be available to help establish a clinic in every area, the NHS England chief executive, Simon Stevens, said. By December, 69 clinics had been set up in England with a further 12 sites earmarked to launch in January.\nBut Louise Barnes, founder of the Post Acute Covid Syndrome 19 (Pacs19) patient advocacy group, said a survey of 200 British members revealed about 90% had not been able to access a clinic because there wasn’t one available, their GP could not refer them or they were declined without explanation. Others were disappointed by the type of services on offer.\nBarnes said: “Patients in the UK have waited going on a year to get support for the multitude of symptoms they’ve been experiencing. To finally think you are going to get referred to a clinic but your GP tells you they don’t have any information, or you get there to find it’s a ‘respiratory-only clinic’ or only staffed by physiotherapists leaves them feeling despondent. For the most part, sadly, patients are coming away massively feeling let down and with no viable treatment plan offered – even a rudimentary one, whilst a treatment is found.\n“We’ve heard very good reports from some of the clinics in Leeds, Leicester, Bristol, and University College hospital (UCH) in London, but there still exist prominent geographical inequalities regarding access with many patients in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland unable to access them at all – likewise in Devon and other areas. Some patients are unable to travel and no transport has been offered.”\nLisa Milburn, 51, from Wakefield, remains signed off work because of the “sloth-like” fatigue and brain fog she’s been suffering since developing Covid a year ago. She lives seven miles from the Leeds long Covid clinic but cannot access it because it falls under a different hospital trust. Her local trust, Mid Yorkshire, is not running a clinic. Her GP referred her for a chest X-ray, blood tests and an electrocardiogram (ECG), which came back normal.\nLisa Milburn photographed at her home in Wakefield in West Yorkshire.She is fortunate to have accessed private physiotherapy and occupational therapy through her employer but said: “I just want an expert to look at me as a whole person and say this is OK, that’s OK, I suggest we do this because it fits in with how we’ve treated post-viral fatigue previously, and I’ll catch up with you again in three weeks.”\nVicky Naylor, from Wigan, has been told her local clinic is currently only seeing NHS staff. The 55-year-old’s GP referred her to a respiratory consultant due to the shortness of breath and lung pain she has experienced since developing coronavirus in March 2020 but she is waiting to be physically assessed.\nShe also has extreme joint and muscle pain, brain fog, and rashes and bruises that come and go. “I want to go to a Covid clinic just to see if they can relieve any of these symptoms. I know it’s very new, and nobody really knows what they’re dealing with, but I need to see someone who is doing research into long Covid and has got an understanding of it,” she said.\nIn Scotland, there are no specific long Covid clinics. Tamsin Stewart, 37, from Balfron in Stirlingshire, has been ill since March last year. “I’ve had basic tests at my local hospital but not seen anyone in person other than a neurologist who suggested I might be imagining it all,” she said. “My GP has been great but can’t do much more for me without consultant help. We need our organs scanned fully and we need to see consultants face to face.”\nEven when a local clinic is available, some patients are disappointed. Fin Edge, 58, from Reading, waited months for an appointment at the Royal Berkshire hospital long Covid clinic and eventually had an online consultation with a doctor. “We spoke about my symptoms, and how I was waiting to complete a 72-hour ECG. He said he would be interested in knowing the results of my ECG, but the lion’s share of his focus was getting me psychological help, and getting me to a physiotherapist. He briefly mentioned pacing [a self-management strategy for activity, involving rest periods].\n“I’d like them to look at why I am a year on and still unable to walk across the room without becoming dizzy or sick. I’d like them to do a CT scan of my lungs, and some endocrine tests. I don’t have good days. What I want is to be heard, to be assessed, to be supported.”\nIf you have been affected or have any information, we'd like to hear from you.

There are clusters of symptoms but at this stage we don’t know which are the ones to worry about, which treatments work and which forms of rehabilitation work.\nAnother issue is resources. Banerjee said: “At UCH it’s working, because we’re a big teaching hospital with lots of people ... [Elsewhere] you’ve got GPs and specialists struggling with the backlog of clinics, surgeries and so on ... Unfortunately the inequalities that you see by ethnicity, by socioeconomic status, by geography, are the ones that are going to be unmasked by this. The scale of this is so big.”\nTrevor Wilson, 53, waited six months for an appointment at the Nottingham assessment clinic but has now had an assessment including a CT scan. It identified minor lung damage so he has been referred back to his GP to see if asthma medication could help. Even so, “I’ve had no real answers, and it didn’t feel like I was getting any support. It felt more like a data-collection exercise. And apparently I’m not going to be seen again,” he said.\nAn NHS spokesperson said: ”We are seeing an increasing number of patients through our network of clinics … and are continuing to learn about the best treatment options for this complex condition. The national guidance is clear that the clinics should offer patients physical, psychological and cognitive assessment and access to a multidisciplinary team, which we will be offering to more patients in the coming months with more clinics set to open.”\nA Scottish government spokesperson said: “Our approach is for people to have access to the support they need in a setting that is as close to their home as possible … [supported by] GPs, wider primary care teams and community based rehabilitation services.”\n""])",politics,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/apr/06/uk-long-covid-patients-facing-postcode-lottery-for-support

76,"('multiple', None, None, ['\nThe mayor of London is to launch a review examining the feasibility of decriminalising cannabis as part of a new approach to tackling drug-related crime.\nShould he be re-elected on 6 May, Sadiq Khan said he would set up an independent London drugs commission to examine the potential health, economic and criminal justice benefits of decriminalising the class-B drug.\nKhan believes there is widespread public support for a more relaxed approach to decriminalisation, citing polls showing more than half of the UK – and nearly two-thirds of those in the capital – support legalising cannabis for adult recreational use.\nAlthough he has ruled out the decriminalisation of class-A drugs such as heroin and cocaine, Khan is willing to consider supporting changes to the legal status of cannabis if that is what the commission concludes. Any actual changes in the law regarding cannabis would, however, fall to the government.\n“It will be for the commission to look at the evidence in the round, but nothing is off the table in the context of what is best for public health and keeping Londoners safe,” said a source close to the mayor.\nThe announcement of the proposal to set up a London drugs commission is expected to be part of Khan’s mayoral election manifesto, published on Tuesday.\nKhan will say fresh ideas are needed to counter the illegal drugs trade, which is damaging both Londoners’ health and their communities, as well as fuelling an increase in organised and violent crime. Too many young people are criminalised for use of of drugs, he believes.\nThe illegal drug trade in the UK is estimated to cost society £19bn per year, according to the mayor’s office. About 41,900 people across England and Wales were charged with drug-related offences last year. Legalising and regulating the sale of cannabis would raise at least £1bn in taxes for the Treasury, according to some estimates.\nBut formally adopting such a position could put him out of step with the Labour leader, who recently said he was opposed to decriminalisation. The current drugs laws were “roughly right”, Keir Starmer told Sky News, though he added that there was “always room for a grown-up debate about how we deal with these cases”.\nThe London drug commission, which would be comprised of independent experts from criminal justice, public health, politics, community relations and academia, would examine how countries around the world have tackled problems with drug use and addiction.\nThis is likely to include looking at evidence from Portugal, where possession and consumption of drugs have been decriminalised since 2001 as part of a wider approach to drugs, including improved treatment programmes and better prevention, education and social support services.\nIt is also likely to consider the experiences of Canada, Uruguay and several US states, where cannabis for recreational use has been legalised. Private use of cannabis is allowed in Spain, while Dutch coffee shops have long sold marijuana.\nThe commission would collate the latest evidence on the effectiveness of UK drug laws, police enforcement and addiction support services. It would report to the mayor with recommendations for City Hall, the government, the police, the criminal justice system, and NHS and treatment services.\nAlthough Khan does not have the powers to introduce new laws, he believes that should the commission recommend decriminalisation of cannabis, a mayoral endorsement would give it a boost.\nKhan, who has in the past called for “an evidence-based conversation” around cannabis, will say: “It’s time for fresh ideas about how to reduce the harms drugs and drug-related crimes cause to individuals, families and communities.\n“The commission will make recommendations focusing on the most effective laws to tackle crime, protect Londoners’ health, and reduce the huge damage that illegal drugs, including cannabis, cause to our communities and society.”\nIn 2019 the cross-party Commons health committee called for the government to consult on the decriminalisation of drug possession for personal use. It said taking a health-based approach would benefit users and reduce harm and costs to the wider community.\nThe Survation survey cited by the mayor’s office, published in July 2019, found that 63% of London residents backed the legalisation and regulation of cannabis, while just 19% opposed the idea. Across the UK as a whole, 47% backed legalisation, with 30% against.\n'])",politics,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/apr/05/mayor-of-london-sadiq-khan-cannabis-legalisation-drugs-commission

They should be able to ask questions of people who are on the ground at this point in time, and that’s a step the WHO could take,” she added.\nChina has been repeatedly accused in western capitals of obstructing investigation of the origins of the coronavirus pandemic in Wuhan including the WHO’s inquiry.\nThe interventions took place after Tedros himself described the team’s issues in getting access to all the information they were seeking.\n“In my discussions with the team, they expressed the difficulties they encountered in accessing raw data,” Tedros said.\n“I expect future collaborative studies to include more timely and comprehensive data sharing,” he said pointedly while adding that the report “advances our understanding in important ways”.\nTedros’s comments came as investigation team members admitted there was political influence from both inside and outside China on them but said they were never under pressure to remove “critical elements” from their report.\nWhile concluding that the two least likely hypotheses for the emergence of the deadly virus – a leak from a lab (pushed by senior Trump officials) and being introduced via frozen food from outside (promoted by China) – the team promised to keep following leads in both cases in what appeared to be a diplomatic effort to keep both Beijing and Washington onside.\nThe report, compiled by WHO-appointed international experts and their Chinese counterparts, did not draw any firm conclusions but did rank a range of hypotheses according to how likely they thought they were, assessing the lab-leak hypothesis “extremely unlikely” with the most likely jumping from bats to humans via an intermediary animal.\n“Although the team has concluded that a laboratory leak is the least likely hypothesis, this requires further investigation, potentially with additional missions involving specialist experts, which I am ready to deploy,” Tedros said.\nChina has been widely faulted in western capitals for its lack of transparency during the opening weeks of the pandemic, and Tedros’s comments mark a rowing back of early praise of China’s initial response as complaints continue from top Biden officials over Chinese openness.\nThe framing of the release of the initial investigation is in line with comments made by team members before visiting Wuhan when they warned that it would be highly unlikely they would find a “smoking gun” during their first visit.\nPeter Ben Embarek with a chart showing pathways of transmission of coronavirus at a press conference at the end of the WHO mission in Wuhan on 26 March.Presenting the report, Peter Ben Embarek, a WHO expert on diseases that jump from animals to humans who led the mission to Wuhan, said they had been unable to find evidence either through China’s surveillance network or excess mortality data for cases of the new coronavirus emerging before December 2019.\n“In terms of key data we looked into data coming out of different surveillance systems looking at cases of fever and unspecified pneumonia … and respiratory syndromes,” he told a press conference in Geneva.\n“We looked at 76,000 cases of symptoms in the months before December to look for Covid cases not picked up, but we didn’t pick up anything.”\nHowever, he added that it remained possible the virus may have been circulating as early as November and that some cases may have been abroad.\nBen Embarek also relayed the concern of Chinese scientists at a Wuhan lab that studies viruses who said they were initially worried it might have escaped but added that there was no evidence it was involved in a leak.\nEchoing Tedros’s remarks, Ben Embarek said there were areas where his team had difficulty getting down to the raw data in China, adding that data would need to be reexamined in the next phase of the probe.\nUnderlining the preliminary nature of the study so far, Ben Embarek said their work had so far “only scratched the surface” of their understanding of the origins.\nDespite studying data of samples from large numbers of farmed wild animals the researchers were unable to find evidence of Covid-19.\nWith so many still unanswered questions, the report has served more to shut down some theories than find a smoking gun, including the mooted possibility that Covid-19 may have been circulating for weeks if not months before it emerged in Wuhan.\nResponding to the report, former US secretary of state Mike Pompeo, who has pushed the lab-leak theory, albeit without evidence, alleged that the report was a cover-up backed by Beijing.\n'])",politics,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/30/who-criticises-chinas-data-sharing-as-it-releases-covid-origins-report

Travel to and from “green” countries will be allowed with no quarantine requirement, although coronavirus tests will still be mandatory before and after travel. Johnson did not provide any details on which countries would probably be “green” or whether any holidays would be allowed from 17 May.\nAddressing the likelihood of international travel in a press briefing on Monday evening, Johnson said: “We are hopeful that we can get going from 17 May, but I do not wish to give hostages to fortune or to underestimate the difficulties we are seeing in some of the destination countries.”\nHeathrow airport’s chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, said it was “disappointing that the opportunity has been missed”.

But it matters because it reveals Britain’s newfound weakness in international trade from outside the EU – and how that weakness may limit the ability of the government to curb the power of big tech.\nBrexit was sold on a myth that buccaneering Britain would be able to use its freedom from EU structures to strike great new trade deals the world over. The problem was twofold: not only was it a daft idea that Britain would expand its exports by trashing its economic relationship with its most important trading partner, it was also simply untrue that agility would somehow trump scale in trade negotiations.\nAs this spat with the US shows, most trading relationships have a very clear dynamic: the larger and stronger party makes its demands, and the smaller and weaker party accepts what it must. That’s why the Brexit deal itself was so one-sided, with the EU securing almost all its objectives in the trade in goods, while Britain failed to achieve its goals in the trade in services. The data already shows that Brexit has been precisely the disaster its critics predicted, only occluded by the even greater crisis of the coronavirus pandemic.\nBrexiters were seduced by some imaginary future where Britain and the US would somehow meet on equal terms. The idea the US would put our interests ahead of its own was always fanciful, based on nothing more than a puff of nostalgia for a transatlantic economic relationship that only ever existed in wartime. The dewy-eyed view of the “special relationship” has always been in London, not Washington.\nAs if to hammer home the point that scale matters, the US had initiated similar proceedings against the EU before deciding to drop them. This emphasises the reality of trade blocs in the 21st century: when two large blocs go head to head, the result is usually stalemate. That’s why there is no comprehensive trade deal between the US and EU, or either the EU or US with China.\nThe US response also shows the power of the big tech lobby. In polarised Washington, there are few points of agreement between Democrats and Republicans, and so it is particularly significant that this dispute was initiated by the Trump administration and yet still progressed by president Biden.\nRather than being a small victory for bipartisanship, it reveals that big tech has co-opted the federal government to advance its interests and to defend its monopoly positions. The power of platforms to reshape the economy is only set to accelerate as new automating technologies disrupt more and more sectors.\nSo EU membership offered Britain much more than merely preferential trading arrangements. It was also a means by which democratically elected governments could confront the power of multinational corporations, acting in the interests of their citizens and in the pursuit of economic justice.\nNo matter the rhetoric of the moment or the vaccine nationalism of this year, the stark reality is that Britain will need to pull closer to the EU in the future if it is to defend its own interests. That process will become a pathway back to membership, which is why so many Brexiters are so Europhobic despite Britain having already left. They know it is only a matter of time.\nFrom climate breakdown to health security to the disruptive forces reshaping the economy, all the most interesting and important problems of the 21st century are collective-action issues. No amount of chest-beating and flag-waving can answer those substantive challenges. Only by working together with our friends and allies can Britain secure prosperity and justice for its citizens. A seemingly small dispute about trade tells us a whole lot more about the future than a fleeting glance might at first suggest.\n'])",business,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/mar/30/biden-tariffs-brexit-britain-eu-big-tech

However, the pandemic has depressed sales for more than a year, and the latest data shows last month’s numbers were still down about 37% below average March levels of 450,000 between 2010 and 2019.\nThe market has improved compared with March 2020, when the first lockdown began, with new car registrations rising 11% last month to 284,000. \nCar dealers have managed to eke out increased sales during lockdowns by bringing in new ways of shopping, including click and collect. The lobby group estimates that the car industry has lost £22.2bn in sales over the past year, but is hoping for a bounce-back as showrooms reopen.\nSales data will be flattered for the next few months by comparisons with the early stages of the pandemic in spring 2020, when all dealerships in the UK were forced to close. In April 2020 – the first full month of lockdown restrictions – sales dropped by 97% to their lowest level since the aftermath of the second world war.\nMike Hawes, the SMMT chief executive, said there was optimism in the industry that sales would recover after the toughest year in modern history for the automotive sector.\n“We know we will see record-breaking growth next month given April 2020 was a washout, but a strong and sustainable market is possible if customers are attracted to the choice and competitive offer the industry is able to provide within the safest of showroom environments,” he said.\nDealers will be allowed to welcome customers into shops on 12 April in England, the largest UK market, when non-essential shops will reopen.\n'])",business,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/apr/06/uk-electric-car-sales-covid-lockdown

It has asked the City of London Corporation, the local authority, to help identify people in need.\n“The City is just empty and we don’t know if it’s going to come back,” said Gray. “We have a duty of care” to those who are struggling, she added.\nVolunteers from the church and NTT Data pack food boxes on Wednesdays. Every Thursday morning, families collect the boxes filled with staples including rice, pasta, tea, cooking oil and cereal, along with fresh fruit and vegetables. Nappies and toiletries are also available. \nA McDonald’s worker, who declined to be named, has been relying on the food bank since July to feed her four children, aged five, seven, 16 and 19. “Before the pandemic I worked in McDonald’s customer assistance at Liverpool Street,” she said. “At first my hours were reduced, and then I was furloughed. I’ve been on furlough ever since. We’ve had to cut down on expenses like food for the family.\n“The impact [of the pandemic] has been unfair as office workers might not have a family to care for. They earn much more than restaurant or shop owners earn and they are still able to earn money now,” she added.\nAnother woman, who works in finance, said she was at the food bank because she was the only one who had been able to keep her job and her salary was not enough to support her children, husband, parents and extended family.\nOne of NTT Data’s clients, the Lloyd’s insurer Ascot Group, has agreed to help fund the food bank in May, and the tech firm is in discussions with three other City-based firms about sponsoring the food bank beyond May. The company has also raised £10,000 from staff and others since launching its fundraising campaign last month.\nWorkers within the City of London are the highest earners in the country, with an average income of £60,000 in 2017-18, compared with £24,000 across the UK, according to HMRC figures.\nClaire Webster, NTT Data’s chief financial officer, said: “What some of the families live off on a weekly basis, £14, is what City workers easily spend on their coffee, breakfast and lunches in a day.”\n'])",business,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/apr/05/how-a-food-bank-is-helping-city-service-workers-survive-the-pandemic

January also set a record after a 9% decline on December’s total.\nAnalysts said the decline in spending on all forms of credit was likely to have continued in March, despite the slight easing in restrictions that from 29 March allows people to gather in groups of six.\nUntil non-essential shops reopen, which is expected to go ahead on 12 April, spending is likely to remain subdued.\n“We doubt much changed in March but this pattern might start to reverse in April as the economy opens up,” said Thomas Pugh, a UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics.\nDuring February, people repaid a net balance of £1.2bn from consumer credit accounts, which the Bank of England said was a slightly smaller net repayment than the average of £1.8bn made since March 2020.\nIn a further sign of household caution, people continued to deposit significant amounts into savings and other deposit accounts, with the accumulation of a further £17.1bn in February.\nThe Bank of England’s chief economist, Andy Haldane, has estimated that bank deposits built up during the Covid-19 pandemic could total £250bn by the autumn and be readily available for households to spend, spurring a strong rebound in growth.\nA combination of the historically low deposit savings interest and the prospect of a return to normal life in June could encourage consumers to spend as much as 20% of the total, although the official Bank of England forecast is for only 5% to be spent later this year.\nMeanwhile, mortgage lending strengthened in February, with people borrowing an additional £6.2bn secured on their homes.\nThis was supported by the expected ending of the temporary stamp duty tax relief at the end of March, which has been extended to end of June, the Bank said.\nIts report added: “February saw the strongest net borrowing since March 2016 (£7.2bn), when borrowing was also boosted by changes in stamp duty.”\nHowever, the February figure could prove to be a peak as the rush to buy wanes over the coming months.\nThe money and credit report said the number of mortgages approved to homebuyers was 87,700 in February, down from 97,350 in January and well below a peak of 103,700 last November.\nNitesh Patel, the strategic economist at Yorkshire Building Society, said: “The market has been on an upward trajectory, despite rising house prices and continued economic uncertainty, with buyers refusing to be deterred from the buying the biggest- ticket item of them all.\n“There is growing evidence that larger homes are currently the most desirable: since March 2020, sales of detached homes have grown from 22% to 28% of all transactions.

They had the same number of points as league leaders PSG, but had been soundly beaten in the Coupe de France by their rivals before the break and were without Zeki Celik and Yusuf Yazici. Burak Yilmaz had made his return after a lengthy injury layoff, but he was only fit enough for the bench. Lille have done well this season to balance their Europa League and league commitments, but this looked to be a bridge too far, especially given that Jérémy Pied’s absence left them without a natural right-back.The hosts were missing Marco Verratti in midfield, due to Covid-19, as well as Mauro Icardi, but the Argentinian may not have started in any event. From the first whistle, PSG sought to put pressure on Tiago Djalo, the youngster who replaced Celik at right-back, by overloading that flank. Ángel Di María, Kylian Mbappé and the fit-again Neymar all took turns to attack on that side of the pitch, leaving Thilo Kehrer to provide width for PSG on the opposite side. With Lille playing an unfamiliar 4-2-3-1, and Renato Sanches filling in on the right wing, Mauricio Pochettino sought to put pressure on the parts of the visitors’ lineup that would be most susceptible to it, but it did not work.\nIn setting his team up in his favoured 4-2-3-1, and playing Neymar centrally, the manager was perhaps asking for trouble. Neymar is far more effective cutting in from the left flank rather than playing as an orthodox No 10, regardless of his own personal preferences. His lack of positional discipline meant PSG had little in terms of width, allowing Djalo and Sanches to be supported (as they ably were) by the likes of Benjamin André and Boubakary Soumaré in extinguishing the threat posed by PSG.\nPochettino made a further misstep in picking Moise Kean to lead the line. The Italian has done well this season, impressing with his running and clever finishing when leading the line or playing on the right flank. But he was sent home from the Italy camp due to exhaustion during the international break so was hardly the best choice to play up front, his fatigue robbing him of his best assets.\nInjuries and considerations about PSG’s clash with Bayern Munich this week played their part, but why did Pochettino stick so stubbornly to his 4-2-3-1? Di María and Neymar have always been better in a 4-3-3. Mbappé has done well playing on the left in Pochettino’s favoured system – and the team should be set up to bring the best from him, rather than Neymar – but the tactics did not work. It was also clear from the first 10 minutes that playing the rather prosaic pair of Leandro Paredes and Idrissa Gueye in midfield was an unnecessarily cautious approach, with Lille happy to play on the counter.\nPSG’s undoing was not just down to tactics. Mbappé and Neymar both missed fine chances in the first half. Aside from forcing Mike Maignan into a fine save 15 minutes into the match, Mbappé offered little, even when he moved to a central role in the second half. Over the international break, he spoke about the mental exhaustion that comes from playing for club and country. While that was likely a factor here, Neymar had no such excuse after having a clear international break. He snatched at his chances and failed to look for his teammates, capping his evening off with an unnecessary dismissal in second-half stoppage time. This was Neymar at his most selfish and it was an ugly scene. The blame for this result lies with both manager and players.\nFinally, though, we should offer deserved praise for the leaders. Christophe Galtier’s hand was forced; he played an unfamiliar system; and he got a fine result. It would have been even more convincing than 1-0 had Yilmaz not been denied in the second half by a fine save from Keylor Navas. Galtier’s best players showed their mettle and those who are not regulars (Soumaré, Djalo) showed they had been well prepared for this encounter.\nCritics may argue that this is not such an achievement given that Lille had two weeks to prepare, but Yazici and Çelik were only excluded from the squad the night before the game. Galtier’s bold choices and the efforts of his players made the difference on the day, just as they have done throughout the season.\nLille will face further challenges before laying hands on the title – including a Lyon side who are desperate to get back into the Champions League – but things are looking good after this performance, especially given that all of their rivals are still involved in other competitions. Galtier’s nous stood in stark contrast to that of his opposite number.

The Manchester United loanee scored for the sixth time in his eighth appearance for David Moyes’s side before creating another two goals as West Ham won a rollicking match and climbed to fourth in the table. In other words, the man who is proving to be one of the signings of the season is guiding his team towards one of the exploits of the season.\nWest Ham have not finished in the top four since 1986 but their display at Molineux suggested they believe that feat is now within their grasp. Lingard got them going with a wonderful goal in the sixth minute and then helped Pablo Fornals and Jarrod Bowen to make it 3-0. But they had to work hard to hold on to that lead against dangerous hosts, who struck back through Leander Dendoncker and Fábio Silva.\n“After 30 games it’s not a fluke to be in the top four,” said Moyes. “We’re there because we’ve played well enough. We’re not in the final furlong, we’ve got a couple of big jumps to go, but we’re challenging so let’s try to do everything to stay there. We’re going to go for it.”\nAfter relinquishing a three-goal lead against Arsenal two weeks ago, West Ham were determined not to let this chance slip, though Moyes said they should have made things more comfortable for themselves after taking another 3-0 lead. “Managing the game is something we need to think about doing much better. We’re in such a good position that I think the boys are just enjoying the thought that we can keep scoring more goals.”\nBoth teams suffered serious blows before this match, with West Ham losing Declan Rice to injury and Wolves deprived of Willy Boly, who tested positive for Covid-19, and Jonny Castro, who tore a cruciate ligament in training on the same knee as eight months ago.\nWolves could have opened the scoring after two minutes, when Daniel Podence gave Willian José an early chance to score his first goal since joining the club in January. The striker drove wide from 14 yards.\nSoon West Ham pushed the hosts backwards. In the fourth minute Michail Antonio glided past Dendoncker and unleashed a fierce long-range shot that Rui Patrício tipped on to the post. Two minutes later West Ham took the lead in irresistible style.\nVladimir Coufal created the goal by winning the ball in his own box, playing a one-two with Fornals and feeding Lingard, still inside West Ham territory. Lingard shifted into a gear that no one else seemed to possess and tore forward 40 yards, evading defenders before firing emphatically past Patrício.\nRayan Aït-Nouri blasted wide as Wolves sought an instant equaliser but soon the visitors increased their lead. Lingard was instrumental again, showing tenacity and trickery to keep the ball alive and play it to Arthur Masuaku, who helped the ball on to Fornals to finish calmly from 10 yards.\nWest Ham’s Jesse Lingard clashes with Wolves’ Pedro Neto after the match.In a thrilling contest Podence then headed on to the crossbar before Antonio fluffed a chance to make it 3-0, misdirecting a header from seven yards out. The West Ham striker limped off in the 36th minute but his replacement, Bowen, scored within moments of arriving. Lingard was again the instigator thanks to another exceptional run and pass, which Bowen rewarded with a crisp finish.\nAfter Willian José and Rúben Neves spurned more chances for Wolves, Dendoncker finally found the net for the hosts just before the break, heading powerfully into the net from a superb run and cross by Adama Traoré.\nNuno Espírito Santo introduced Silva for Podence and switched to 4-4-2 for the second half. But West Ham emerged as the more dangerous side, Bowen twice going close to increasing their lead. However, Silva set West Ham’s nerves jangling when he made it 3-2, finishing smartly from a tight angle after classy service by Pedro Neto.\nWolves did their utmost to find an equaliser but Dendoncker and Neto snatched at their best chances, both failing to keep shots down from inviting range.\n'])",sports,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/apr/05/wolves-west-ham-premier-league-match-report

Over the past six seasons Gillingham have, according to the FA, spent £86,457 on agents’ fees, a figure eclipsed by fourth-tier Salford City in the last year alone. Across that six-year period Manchester United have paid intermediaries £125m, and Liverpool’s £143m spend is enough to buy Gillingham’s £600,000 record signing Carl Asaba 238 times.\nGillingham are an anomaly in an era awash with super-agents and overspend. They will not pay agent fees unless they “absolutely have to”. “I don’t aim to pay zero,” says the club’s owner, Paul Scally, who celebrated 25 years as chairman last summer. “There are occasions when I have to pay an agent but I try and avoid it and do it very rarely. I don’t like agents. I don’t like their business, their trade. We managed before agents came along and it was probably a better world.\n“For the first 10 years I dealt with players or their families, sometimes a solicitor or a representative, but most of the time I dealt with players. They would come in and we would agree a contract. Since agents came in it’s gone downhill from there. I think they either don’t bother coming to us because they know I don’t like agents, I’m not going to pay them a fee or will fight them over a fee … or they realise that they’ll get their player in the shop window, we’ll develop their player, their player will then have more worth and if they get sold to a Championship club they will get more money.”\nPlaying hardball does not mean Gillingham struggle to get players through the door; since last summer they have loaned a dozen and made 11 permanent signings, seven of which, according to the FA, involved agents. “If an agent represents a player, then the player should pay the agent,” says Scally, whose annual budget is about £2.6m. “I shouldn’t pay the agent. In times of austerity, such as we are, I’m looking at every penny to keep the business going. Why would I waste money on agents? We don’t need them in our industry.”\nPaul Scally says money is being handed to agents that ‘should have been fed down into the pyramid’.Shrewsbury, Gillingham’s third-tier opponents on Saturday, coughed up £95,000 in agent fees and the league leaders Hull City £543,238. By Championship standards Wycombe (£126,053) and Millwall (£255,715) paid a pittance, but why do more clubs not resist paying vast sums? “Because the people that make those decisions are weak,” says Scally. \n“The people that make the decisions to pay the agents are often not the owners; they are often people working on behalf of their owners. They are weak because, invariably, it is not their money and they think the money is just going to keep on coming, keep on coming. They think bringing these players in is going to guarantee them success and promotion. That is why the Championship is in such a mess, because of this frenzy to get hold of the Premier League money.”\nThe millions spent by top-flight clubs, four of whom have used the government’s furlough scheme, particularly rankle. “It’s absolutely pathetic. It is all money that should have stayed in the game and should have been fed down into the pyramid. When League One and League Two asked for some help [to combat the impact of Covid-19], they all cried poverty. So we ended up with a £30m grant and £20m loan. We are going to them with begging bowls when they are paying that kind of money to agents.\n“When you talk to fans generally, they are sick and tired of the nonsense at their club, the waste and the money they are spending on wages, agents etc. The average man cannot relate to the sums of money that are being wasted in the Premier League and, to some extent, in the Championship.”\nSign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors’ picks.Mehmet Dalman, the Cardiff City chairman, has said the game requires a “Big Bang” to reset financial order and Fifa is pressing ahead with plans to introduce controversial regulations for agents. The dizzying numbers have made Scally question his future across a challenging 12 months but he has been encouraged by emails of support from fans since detailing some of his observations in a 14-page open letter last month. Gillingham remain fiercely competitive despite operating within rigid parameters.\n“There are people who have supported us for 40 years saying: ‘We’re never going to be a top, top club, we’re never going to be glamorous but we’re still going and we love what we’ve got because it’s real,’” Scally says. “If the Premier League and the Professional Footballers’ Association don’t get their heads out of their backsides and start realising the way they are going there is no sustainable long-term future, it is going to be a very rocky road ahead.”\n'])",sports,https://www.theguardian.com/football/football-league-blog/2021/apr/06/how-did-gillingham-become-the-only-efl-club-not-to-pay-agents-a-penny-football
89,"('multiple', None, None, ['\nRory McIlroy will require no reminding that a 6&5 trouncing on Wednesday by Ian Poulter at the WGC Match Play arrived just 15 days before his latest tilt at completing a career grand slam. How McIlroy, clearly in the midst of technical struggles, must wish the Masters didn’t arrive in early April. For now, the Northern Irishman’s best hope is the grounds of Augusta National somehow summon the kind of touch that has painfully deserted him in recent weeks.\nPoulter, such a specialist in this format during Ryder Cups, was probably the last player McIlroy fancied facing on day one in Austin. The Englishman was dominant from the start, racing into a three-hole lead after five. When McIlroy clawed that advantage back to 1 up on the 8th green, Poulter reeled off five winning holes in a row to claim the match. McIlroy’s wayward play was summed up at the 5th, where his tee shot finished in a neighbouring swimming pool.\nPoulter was understandably fair towards his Ryder Cup teammate. “I played well,” he said. “I played well and the scoreline’s pretty flattering to be honest with you. But I kept Rory under pressure and I made it difficult for him. He hit a couple of loose shots but putting the ball in pretty tight and taking control of the match, I had to do that against Rory.”\nMcIlroy has formalised his relationship with the swing coach Pete Cowen as he bids to revive his fortunes. “I think there’s a couple of areas of his game which I’m sure he wants to firm up a little bit,” Poulter said. “Obviously he missed a couple of tee shots left. He was trying to hit a kind of hold-up cut.\n“But it’s Rory, it doesn’t take a lot for Rory to spark up pretty quickly and I wasn’t surprised with anything. I just felt that I had done a pretty decent job of putting him under pressure. I made it difficult for him.” Poulter’s seven birdies and an eagle endorse that point entirely.\nA format designed to please broadcasters and sponsors means McIlroy must complete group matches against Cameron Smith and Lanto Griffin rather than beat a hasty retreat from Texas.\nMeanwhile, the European Tour hopes to attract 1,000 spectators a day to the British Masters in May, after applying to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport to be included in a batch of pilot events aimed at testing the return of crowds to venues.\nThe FA Cup final and World Snooker Championship have already been confirmed as pilot competitions, with the DCMS aiming for “around a dozen”. Golf differs from those competitions as a designated outdoor, non-stadium sport.\nThe DCMS refused to offer specific comment on the situation regarding the British Masters, with a spokesman pointing out the complete makeup of test events will be confirmed in the coming weeks.\nThe European Tour hopes its positive relationship with the government, which was instrumental in golf’s six-week UK swing last summer, will help the case for the British Masters. The tournament at the Belfry on 12-15 May will be hosted by the former Masters champion Danny Willett.\n'])",sports,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/mar/24/british-masters-golf-bid-for-crowds-at-proposed-covid-pilot-event-in-may

92,"('multiple', None, None, ['\nWell, now that Godzilla vs Kong is out, it looks like we’re back on. Because Godzilla v Kong is everything anyone wants from a film like this. Two big dumb animals slugging each other in new and different ways for barely any reason at all, and the whole thing is wrapped up in less than two hours.\nBetter yet, the film understands how stupid it is. These might qualify as spoilers, so skip this paragraph if you haven’t seen it yet, but the film begins with King Kong having a shower. There’s a bit in the middle where Godzilla literally blasts a hole all the way to the centre of the Earth just on the off-chance that some rubble might smack King Kong on the head in the process. There’s a skyscraper-tall robot kung-fu lizard who, while ostensibly the baddie, you sort of end up rooting for. There are several scenes where humans run from peril with such impressive ham-fistedness that you will genuinely come to believe that the original intention was to soundtrack them all with Yakety Sax. The whole thing is dumber than a box of farts, but the film never tries not to lean away from it. It’s beautiful.\nAnd now, quite frankly, all I want to do is watch versus movies. Where once there was a wasteland, now I see nothing but promise. The Monsterverse, clearly, needs to go on forever. If it can maintain this tone, rather than default to the hollow awe of the much worse Godzilla: King of the Monsters, then it deserves to run and run. Let’s bring back Gigan (essentially a giant knife-armed ninja), or King Caesar (a sort of huge gormless dog who can only be woken up if a princess sings a full three-minute song at him) and make them fight Godzilla and Kong. Heck, let’s chuck the Cloverfield monster back into the mix, and one or two of whatever those things from Pacific Rim were as well. The more the merrier. The Monsterverse is basically the WWE at this point, so we may as well make it a Royal Rumble.\nThen, I suggest going back and fixing the errors of the past. 1966’s Billy the Kid vs Dracula, for example, featured almost no scenes of Billy the Kid fighting Dracula. Let’s change that. Let’s make a new film where, right from frame one, Billy the Kid and Dracula just Tom and Jerry the knickers out of each other like the clappers. Imagine the last third of Home Alone, but starring a cowboy and a vampire. Brilliant, right? Or let’s have another shot at Alien vs Predator, but this time there’s just one Predator and one Alien, and they’re both 300 metres tall, and nobody ever adequately explains what’s going on. You’d watch that. You’re angry that you can’t already watch that.\nAnd then the fun can really start; scouring other franchises for suitable versus movie candidates. God knows there are a lot of them. You could revive the Terminator series by making a film where an old T-800 has a boxing match with Rocky Balboa. Or a film where James Bond fights The Rock and Jason Statham from Hobbs and Shaw. Or, and I’m just spitballing here, Harry Potter vs Jurassic Park.\nIt’s similarly bewildering that Disney – which produced seven of the top 10 films of 2019 – hasn’t already got in on this. Imagine Snow White vs Cinderella. Imagine Aladdin vs Wreck-It Ralph. Imagine, and I mean this, Frozen versus The Lion King. Imagine Elsa from Frozen fighting an actual lion for two hours, and being mauled whenever she started to sing.\nAnd then, with the formula for this sort of thing definitely cracked, let’s have another shot at Batman vs Superman. Make it lighter and less rain-soaked. Make Batman and Superman clatter each other with saucepans and cricket bats, and edit in a load of SPROING sound effects whenever they do. Make Batman hit Superman with an antique vase at one point, and have the vase’s owner stand next to them while it happens, and make his monocle pop out at the moment of impact. Make it exactly 87 minutes long, including credits. This is the film we should have got in 2016. And, thanks to the majesty of Godzilla vs Kong, it’s the movie we can have again.\n'])",entertainment,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/apr/06/terminator-rocky-godzilla-king-kong-versus-movie

An open thread will run for the rest of the television series to allow readers to discuss the programme, as her expertise and passion is regarded as irreplaceable.\nShe wrote a number of candid pieces for the Observer about her illness. In one article, published in November in the Observer magazine, she spoke of coping with cancer against the backdrop of lockdown, her love for her family and the advice she would give to any reader.\n“Even in these depressing times try to find some part of the day that is worth relishing, whether it is a moment of beauty half-glimpsed outside, the joy found in escaping into a different world on page or screen, or the pleasure of dressing up for yourself and no one else because it makes you feel fine,” she wrote.\nPaul Webster, editor of the Observer, said: “She was a remarkably talented and versatile journalist, writing about TV, films, books, sport, and living life to the full, with insight, elegance and skill.”\nKatharine Viner, Guardian editor-in-chief, said: “Sarah was a wonderful writer, who wrote brilliantly about TV, books and much else for the Observer and the Guardian.\n“Her episode-by-episode recaps on Line of Duty, Game of Thrones and other shows helped redefine arts writing for the digital age, building warm and loyal communities around each. She also wrote powerfully about her illness. She will be terribly missed both by her colleagues and by her readers.”\nAmong those paying tribute to her was Jed Mercurio, the television writer and creator of Line of Duty, who said everyone involved in the series was saddened by news of her death.\n“Her writing stood out as being inspired by a love of TV, stimulating others to feel the same and adding to her readers’ enjoyment of their favourite programmes. We send our deepest sympathies to her family, friends and colleagues,” he added. \nThe screenwriter and television producer Sarah Phelps – known for her work on EastEnders and BBC serial adaptations, including Agatha Christie’s The Witness For the Prosecution, The ABC Murders and The Pale Horse, as well as of JK Rowling’s The Casual Vacancy – described Hughes as a “brilliant, brilliant writer”. Phelps said it had always been a great pleasure to talk to her and read her work. “Sarah was such a champion of my work and a passionate generous advocate of TV. She was endlessly curious, hilarious and kind, an incisively brilliant and fearless writer. She will be so very missed,” Phelps said.\nVicky Frost, who was TV and radio editor at the Guardian when Hughes persuaded her to commission increasingly popular episode-by-episode recaps for Game of Thrones and Line of Duty, said she had “a real fan’s eye” for the shows that people were going to get obsessed with.\n“I think what makes her recaps so great is that she really watched shows as a fan and valued the conversation the recaps prompted. They really do embody that idea of watching telly with obsessive friends you’ve never met,” she added.\nToby Moses, TV editor at the Guardian, said: “She was a pleasure to work with, both in the office and virtually – she had a skill with a recap that is unsurpassed, the hundreds of adoring commenters were testament to that. She’ll be hugely missed.”\nHughes began her career in sports journalism, writing about basketball and college football for the New York Daily news and covering horse racing and football on her return to the UK. She went on to write for British national newspapers, including the Independent, Independent on Sunday, the i, Telegraph and Metro, as well as the Guardian and Observer.\nIn 2004 she was shortlisted for an Amnesty International award for her reports with the photojournalist Kate Holt on abuses by UN peacekeepers in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).\n“Sarah had a wonderful way of turning interviews from places like the DRC or Burundi into stories that people could relate to,” said Holt, who recalled her portrayal of the lives of teenage girls who were being forced to sleep with UN peacekeepers.\n“Sarah carried this ability to see the world through others’ eyes and write eloquently on deeply emotional and complex subjects as her career and life developed.”\nShe is survived by her husband, Kris, with whom she shared a mutual love of Tottenham Hotspur, and two children, Ruby and Oisín, 13 and 11. “She truly was one of a kind she never took a single sideways step, and was the best wife and mother one could have wished for in their wildest dreams,” he said.\n'])",entertainment,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/apr/06/brilliant-and-versatile-observer-and-guardian-journalist-sarah-hughes-dies-at-48
94,"('multiple', None, None, ['\nt happens about once a year. A film is released, often featuring major stars and a shockingly large budget, that is so mind-numbingly bad that the critical response is akin to a ritual killing: its flaws must be dissected, its creative choices mocked and its actors shamed for their poor judgment. Recent entries in this contemptible canon include The Snowman, The Book of Henry and, wrongly, Serenity, the unhinged 2019 Matthew McConaughey mystery about a guy named Dill, a fish named Justice and a tropical island made up of ones and zeroes.Serenity arrived with an impressive pedigree. It was written and directed by Steven Knight, who created TV’s Peaky Blinders, and wrote and directed 2013’s Locke, a tense little drama starring Tom Hardy and set entirely in a car that has achieved a minor following. Knight clearly has talent to spare, and with Oscar winners McConaughey and Anne Hathaway on board, expectations for Serenity were high. The first warning sign came when the film, slated for an awards-season release date, was quietly pushed to January, often a sign that the studio thinks it has a bomb on its hands.\nAnd yes, it’s easy to see why there would be skepticism about Serenity’s ability to connect with the public. This is a film operating on a wavelength all its own. Set on the fictitious island of Plymouth, it starts off as a lean film noir centering on Baker Dill, a frequently shirtless, profoundly tanned fishing boat captain who is almost religiously obsessed with a single quest: catching a massive tuna that seems to be always hanging around his boat. No, it’s not a documentary about what the real McConaughey does on vacation, but it might as well be. It’s impossible to imagine anyone else in the role. Dill gets diverted when his ex-wife (Hathaway) walks into his life with a proposition to kill her new husband (Jason Clarke), a high-income, low-class brute who abuses her and terrifies the child she had with Dill. It’s a fair deal: she gets her freedom, and Dill gets $10m, which will mean he can quit taking drunken tourists out sport-fishing and spend all his time searching for his white whale, er, tuna.\nThe Florida noir is a hallowed genre with entries like Key Largo, Night Moves, Body Heat and Wild Things. It’s built on simple pleasures: aqua blue seas, white sand, half-clothed movie stars and the schadenfreude of watching one man’s paradise turn into a hell on earth. Serenity plays these notes with verve so what, you might ask, is up with its terrible reputation? Well, it has something to do with the prim, proper man in a suit (Jeremy Strong) following Dill around, desperate to talk to him about “the rules”. Or the fact that Dill seems to have a telepathic connection with his son, who we often see parked in front of a computer screen, writing code. Or the fact that Diane Lane shows up in just two scenes as a woman Dill sleeps with for cash, and why on earth would a character who looks like Diane Lane ever need to pay for sex?\nSlowly, a hidden truth emerges. It’s not quite right to call it a spoiler, since knowing about the plot in advance is by far the best enticement to see the film. Here it is: everything we’re seeing is a computer game created by Dill’s son. Plymouth Island doesn’t exist. Neither does Baker Dill, at least not in that world. The kid has created a game, in which his real father kills his new stepfather, as a coping mechanism, and in the film’s admirably off-the-rails second half, Dill starts to uncover the truth of his surroundings. He finds a map (in his own home, mind you) that shows Plymouth Island surrounded by miles of nothing. He peppers the locals with questions only to discover they have no knowledge of the world outside their limited purpose. It’s The Truman Show for simulation theory geeks.\nBut it’s also the kind of wild swing for the fences that critics and moviegoers alike spend so much time complaining aren’t made any more. For all its flaws, Serenity represents a full commitment to a director’s gonzo vision that, in a sea of franchises designed to fulfill audience expectations and do little else, is as refreshing as a dip in the Gulf of Mexico on a hot summer day. Overstuffed with idiosyncrasies, Serenity feels like a mainline into the head of its writer-director, chronicling his obsessions and perversions with little concern for looking foolish. After all, this is a film in which a pre-teen boy crafts a virtual world in which his father is a part-time gigolo and his parents have angry sex in the cabin of a fishing boat. Kudos to Knight for thinking that was something audiences wanted to think about.\nAnd in McConaughey, Knight found the perfect actor to embody his cosmic vision. When it comes to pontificating on the nature of the universe, neither one seems to have an off switch. It’s easy to imagine the two of them on-set, engulfed in a haze of pot smoke, egging each other on to make the story more outlandish with every scene. But McConaughey is the one spouting this insane dialogue – “You know how in Plymouth we like to say everybody knows everything? Wouldn’t it be funny if the truth was nobody knows anything?” – and there’s no other actor in this dimension who could make such inanity sound believable. Watching Serenity is a bit like listening to McConaughey give a Ted Talk on the singularity, and whether it leaves you cackling with laughter, bored out of your skull, or simply in slack-jawed awe at its confidence that anyone will care, it’s a trip you won’t soon forget.\n'])",entertainment,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/apr/05/hear-me-out-why-serenity-isnt-a-bad-movie

If you want your friends to think that you have become really fancy over lockdown, this is the burger to serve. \nPeople declare the tall burger dead all the time, and yet it clings on to life. So, for the last time: stop making tall burgers. Thin burgers taste better and have a much more pleasant texture. More importantly, you can eat them without looking like a snake eating an egg. Look at Bon AppÃ©titâ\x80\x99s smash burger recipe. Itâ\x80\x99s just seasoned beef that gets smashed down on the griddle with a spatula while it cooks. And itâ\x80\x99s ready in three minutes. \nAs a vegan alternative, hereâ\x80\x99s Avant Garde Veganâ\x80\x99s plant-based â\x80\x98In & Out burgerâ\x80\x99. Again, this requires a ton of ingredients â\x80\x93 this time black beans, miso paste, Marmite, wheat gluten, soy sauce â\x80\x93 and they have to be steamed for an hour and then cooled before you can grill them. But itâ\x80\x99s worth it because these are pretty flipping close to the real thing. \nVietnamese-style burgers.Now, letâ\x80\x99s explore the outer reaches of the burger world together. A 2013 Guardian-readersâ\x80\x99 recipe-swap article threw up a beautiful salty/sweet Vietnamese bun cha recipe. The pork patties contain chicken stock powder, fish sauce and actual caramel, but all the cloyingness this suggests is offset by the sharp stab of pickled carrots and papaya. â\x80\x9cYou can smell the pork sizzling on the makeshift barbecues all around Hanoi,â\x80\x9d says Jess Waller, who submitted the recipe, and I have never missed foreign travel more. \nI should also draw your attention to Anna Jonesâ\x80\x99s carrot burger. A bunch of carrots, roasted with paprika and cumin, blitzed with tofu and formed into buns. Just to add to the sensation of California-style clean eating, you can pile the burgers high with Jonesâ\x80\x99s avocado and cherry tomato salsa. \nThe Bosh! Boys have a recipe for bhaji burgers that, while it seems designed to give purists a heart attack, happens to be quite delicious. As they put it, these deep-fried beauties are â\x80\x9cgreat with mint raita, or you can make smaller bhaji bites and serve them with curryâ\x80\x9d. \nThe final meat-free recipe today is vegetarian rather than vegan, and for good reason. Itâ\x80\x99s Kitchen Sanctuaryâ\x80\x99s cheesy veggie burgers, and as such contains quite a lot of egg, cream and cheese. Theyâ\x80\x99re all cooked into the patty along with carrots, potatoes and green beans. If you havenâ\x80\x99t quite made the leap to veganism yet, this is a pretty good treat. \nNow, finally, remember when I cancelled the tall burger? Well, Iâ\x80\x99m going to uncancel it, but only for a moment. The way I see it, if youâ\x80\x99re going to make a tall burger, you should make it so tall that itâ\x80\x99s impossible to eat. And thatâ\x80\x99s where Calgary food truck Alley Burgerâ\x80\x99s whole truck burger comes in. Thereâ\x80\x99s a giant slab of meat, covered in cheese curd and topped with a fried egg, four rashers of bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, jalapeÃ±os, onion and aioli. Genuinely obscene. \n'])",entertainment,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/apr/06/barbecues-are-back-ten-perfect-burgers-to-try-from-vegan-bean-to-bhaji-bites
